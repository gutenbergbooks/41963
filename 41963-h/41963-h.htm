<br /><small>"Hinter die Kirche bl√ºhe die blaue Blume der Zufriedenheit."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Meister
Eckhart.</span></small></h2>

<p>Widow Bourn's house stood behind the
church, and blue flowers grew contentedly
on the sloping green, shy fancies of a maiden
spring that never lasted out a summer's experience.
New England churches have not
that air of nestling comfort which seemed to
Meister Eckhart so sweet a symbol. They
crown the hills with square frames and sharpened
steeples, churches militant, plate-mailed
in clapboards, with weather-vane aimed defiantly
into the wind. Their doors are closed,
their windows shuttered against all days of
the week saving one. But Widow Bourn
found the proximity comfortable. The church
militant faced the issues of the spirit for her,
and subdued them. She plodded through
her Bible, drawing contentment from texts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
that meant no such matter, seeing in the ecclesiast's
despondency only reflections connected
here and there with sermons. "It is a
pleasant thing to stand on the shore when
other people are in the floods," the melancholy
Roman poet remarked, meaning that it <i>would
be</i>, because it was something his ever-journeying
spirit in the waste seas of thought rendered
impracticable for himself.</p>

<p>A gate opened from the widow's garden on
the sloping green. Heavy-scented lilacs, purple
and white, hung over it, and followed the
fence at fragrant intervals. Lilacs crowded
along the garden walls, pushed against green
pillars of the porch and drooped luxurious
heads at the windows. Lilacs are tropical and
anti-puritan; they belong with the chuckle
of lutes over low casements, and liquid voices
speaking a vowelled tongue. Widow Bourn
was pleasant-tempered, placid, possessed of a
stillness, a certain dignity, and a frame not
overpadded, but comfortable.</p>

<p>The Bourns were early settlers in Hagar.
The settlers were still feeling their way in the
wilderness beyond the Connecticut, sensible
farmers who bargained for whole mountain
ranges and valleys of the magnificent savage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
and recorded the transaction in minutes of the
town-meeting. The magnificent savage commonly
declared that his heart was great; he
would sell the lands from the crooked lake to
the joining of swift rivers to his white brothers,
who marked the boundaries inferred from the
sachem's oratory, and omitted to comment on
the humor of it in minutes of the town-meeting.
When the first Simon Bourn piled hewn
beams for his cabin and ran his plough around
stumps of trees that had furnished the beams
there were few cabins in the neighborhood,
and the town-meeting was held fifteen miles
away. The last Simon Bourn ran his plough
along the same hill-side, not dodging the same
stumps, but the hill-side still drew up stones
out of its inner perversity to check his plough.
He found the slope of his life, like the slope
of his ancestral fields, unfertile, shallow-soiled.
The five generations of Bourns had accumulated
and transmitted this opinion of their lives
and hilly fields, that on the whole they were
not justified.</p>

<p>Simon died in the early fifties and was buried
in Hagar's hemlocked graveyard. Oddly
enough, he seemed to regret it. Widow Bourn
associated herself with this regret, but regret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
has commonly an element of interrupted possibilities
in it, and these must have lain the
rather in Nellie, a yellow-headed, long-limbed,
swift-footed maiden whose level gray eyes had
in them a certain challenge and accusation,
and whose years were ten.</p>

<p>"Don't let Nellie forget me," he said, and
the graver carved on his tombstone, "Remember
Me." Simon perhaps intended it
only for Nellie, but that did not prevent its
forcing the passer to "remember" him, who
never knew him and did not care about it.
"Simon Bourn&mdash;Born&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;, Died&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;. Remember,"
in raised letters on a white tombstone,
stared out of the green gloom of the hemlocks.
So the Elder Hamlet desired, "Remember Me."
"Remember thee, poor ghost?" Why remember?
Go your ways, Simon Bourn, and
trouble us not. It might have struck the
public as egotistic, which was only a pathetic
impulse pointing to Nellie, if the public had
not been in the habit of accepting epitaphs of
all kinds with a tolerance born of experience.</p>

<p>One could understand the exception Simon
made in favor of Helen from his opinion and
feeling about the world he left&mdash;that it was
not on the whole justified&mdash;could understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
it in this way, that there was something
in her young gravity and impetuous faith
which seemed to isolate whatever she looked at.
To be considered and remembered by her seemed
important. It lifted one out of triviality.
In Hagar she was a pronounced, a separate
person. Hagar itself was compact of varieties,
but Helen was intense in conception and direct
in action to surprise Hagar. She ran away
with Morgan Map to the Hamilton County
Fair, and came back in the gray dawn, white-lipped
with weariness. A neighbor or two
had sat up with Widow Bourn to prevent her
worrying. It was a gratifying success. The
widow slept by the fire. Morgan was eighteen
then, but the Maps were somewhat out of
the reach of Hagar's opinion. She smote Mr.
Paulus with a paint-brush across the face for
interfering with her painting designs on cows
and cats. They were not his cows and cats.
That question in ethics threw Hagar into excited
division, and it was not remembered
whose cows and cats they were. She was sent
to Miss Savage's School in Wimberton; muttering
rumors of her crossed the Cattle Ridge.
At sixteen she was thrown by one of the Sanderson
horses, a red-eyed, ugly breed of racers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and Joe Sanderson, then aged nine, ran at the
horse and shot a barbed arrow into its hide,
out of his bitter wrath and love of Nellie; and
Nellie lay a twelvemonth and more on her
back to cure her spine. These are but instances
of enterprise. Whatever stood the
challenge or test of worth and reality in her
eyes was apt to be a cause of sudden valor or
unreckoned devotion.</p>

<p>The accident was in 1858, the year after
Squire Map's wife died, whose name was once
Edith Lorn. There was a great funeral in
Hagar, and carriages from down the Wyantenaug
Valley as far as Hamilton. There
was an explosion then, too, in the Map family
regarding property. Gerald and Morgan were
supposed to have announced their independence
on the strength of their majority and inheritance.
The squire took to himself a grudge
against the world where sons are unfilial,
friends betray, and love falls from negation to
negation, and began that lonely life which
lasted twenty years, shut in and brooding in
the square house on the hill half a mile out on
the Cattle Ridge road. Gerald Map came
no more to Hagar, but Morgan was seen at
times. He rode up from Hamilton the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
after Helen's fall, talked with the doctor, went
up-stairs and kissed her cheek, and departed,
silent to Widow Bourn's murmured remonstrance. He shouldn't do that!"</p>

<p>Helen said: "Oh, that's all right," indifferently,
and Widow Bourn fell to extracting
comfort from the situation. If a honey-bee
extracts anything from anywhere, it is honey;
she may not extract anything. There was a
comfort in knowing where Helen was the day
long; not that the widow's comfort had ever
been seriously long disturbed, but Helen quiescent
was more comfortable than Helen active,
in process of silent loading or sudden discharge.
One could consider her clothes at leisure, not in
heated endeavor to have one dress for Sunday
without a lateral or perpendicular rip. Everything
in the balm of the widow's temperament
took the soft flow of slow waters, as Simon's
plaintive discontent had long before to her ears
come to resemble Ecclesiastes. Helen was
more difficult to adapt herself to, because Helen
grew and changed. Now, the growth and
change seemed for the time to have ceased.
She was no less mysterious; but a mystery
which is constant and presents the same inscrutable
face, and not always another and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
another, is more comfortable. Helen's life,
after cataracts and restless seeking, seemed
to have flowed into a dark pool, and lay there
reflecting clouds, patches of stars, and the
edges of dim forests.</p>

<p>The similitudes of young maidens and
varied flowers, the happy possibilities in that
comparison, were discovered of earliest poets.
Out of the best of intentions there has come
to us so far only the conviction that Helen
did not resemble the blue violets growing behind
the church in Hagar. As for Simon's
epitaph, it outlasts the story and is still to be
read. One may lean over the wall of the cemetery,
say, at twilight, when the shadow of
Windless Mountain is wide over Hagar, and
read it to-day, note its stiff insistence, and
suit one's self with reflections on man and nature
and the purport of things. An issue will
be observed to lie between Simon's epitaph
and the solemn, fading mountain, an issue
distinct and inclusive.</p>

<br />
<br /><small>Of Thaddeus Bourn and his Purposes</small></h2>

<p>There was given to the Bourns, then, of
old, natures sloping to the Northern side,
or they had taken that tendency from experience.
Thaddeus Bourn, that elder brother
of Simon, who left Hagar so long ago as when
Quincy Adams was President, and became a
civil flower of society in the city of Hamilton,
was a spontaneous variation or reaction from
the type. One heard that he had made a fortune
airily, and lost it. He surely married another,
lost part of that, and his wife of a year
or two, who died and surprised him into regretting
her with some sincerity. He became
an official of the Hamilton County Bank, and
floated on in middle life, buoyant, carrying an
aroma of old fashions, a flower in his buttonhole,
a tall hat, a silver-headed cane. His
eyes had wrinkles about them, his cheeks were
thin, his foot light. All these were evident elements
in the total of Thaddeus, but the total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
itself was not a sum, but a harmony. To keep
the seamy side of life turned down, and its
sheen always in the sun, not only was Thaddeus's
practice and theory, but he belonged to a
distinct school in the practice of the art, which
might be called the pseudo-classic.</p>

<p>He sat by Helen's bed half a day, and talked
to her as to a grown lady, and was gracious
and fluent. He brought the best flowers of
his worldliness, and jingled all his silver bells
to please her.</p>

<p>"Not a finer pair of eyes in Hamilton!"
he said to the widow. "Positively she must
not have a crick in her back. On my word,
impossible."</p>

<p>"We are taught to submit," said the widow,
perhaps placidly, at any rate patiently. Thaddeus
mounted the stairs with a wrinkled
smile.</p>

<p>"Sheep! That woman is a sheep! Helen,
my dear, your back will be as straight as my
cane, I give you my word."</p>

<p>Nellie's lean hands, on the coverlet, and face,
with its bacchante spread of hair above her
head on the pillow, were losing their brown
tan in the passage of slow weeks. The delicate
creeping pallor and helplessness beckoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Thaddeus to something tender, but he took
council with wisdom.</p>

<p>"Uncle Tad," she said, "why do you about
always feel good?"</p>

<p>"Well, well, I haven't cracked my spine.
Never cracked anything but my heart and
reputation&mdash;a&mdash;both of them like old varnish,
on my word. Very good, varnish them again.
I have"&mdash;Thaddeus used his gold eye-glasses
gracefully to punctuate, emphasize, distinguish,
for illustration, for ornament&mdash;"I have
the opinion that to feel agreeable and to be
agreeable are two habits that one cultivates
like a garden. The first is a vegetable, the
second a flower. You see? Exactly. In point
of fact they are the fruit and flower of the same
plant. A&mdash;a figure of speech, Nellie. If you
kindly wouldn't look at me like the Angel of
Judgment. A&mdash;look at the ceiling. Thank
you."</p>

<p>Thaddeus delicately unfolded his theory of
the conduct of life, Nellie's grave eyes now
and then confusing him with mute challenge.</p>

<p>To his experience, then, there were two classes
of people&mdash;those who were more or less pleased
with the world, and those who more or less
were not. Both personally and morally it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
better to be in the former class. Personally,
for instance, one lived longer; morally, one,
for instance, in point of fact, kept in better
relations with Providence. Now this satisfaction
was to be compassed partly by a certain
inward insistence on feeling agreeable&mdash;"When
I buy a pair of glasses of a seller of
glasses, personally, I buy a pair that&mdash;a&mdash;slightly
idealize"&mdash;partly by surrounding one's
self by, in point of fact, a judicious selection
of circumstances. Circumstances were, in the
main, people. One surrounded one's self with&mdash;that
is, one sought and lived among&mdash;agreeable
people, and these were found commonly among
such as had circumstances already agreeable.
Selfishness was a word to keep on good terms
with by understanding its nature, and making
one's own share of it intelligent. Enlightened
selfishness was the root of society. Good
society really consisted of people who had the
time and took the pains to be pleasant and
entertaining, in order to have pleasure and
entertainment about them. This was the
sensible and experienced thing in the matter
of the pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p>"Nellie"&mdash;Thaddeus's voice took a note of
gravity&mdash;"you'll let me have an interest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
your pursuit. Some time"&mdash;the wrinkles of
his smile shot out around his eyes&mdash;"I'll explain
to you how it is a case of enlightened
selfishness. Between you and me, I'm growing
old, but ordinarily I deny it."</p>

<p>It is possible that Nellie understood very
little of Thaddeus's doctrine, saw no distinct
consequences whatever, and was only caught
by little gleaming points of illustration. The
charm of Thaddeus's talk lay in its opalescent
effect, and this had much to do with gesture
and expression; so that "good society" may
have been to her a phrase of the haziest quality,
except as it might mean a pair of slightly idealized
eye-glasses, rimmed with gold, and pointed
at one in a manner to absorb attention; "happiness,"
a certain wrinkled smile; and the
"pursuit" of it an endeavor to smile in that
way. Thaddeus thought his doctrine likely to
suffer much translation. He could not follow
its vanishing nor guess what would happen
to it.</p>

<p>It was a period of brooding and slow change
for Helen. At such times, one remembers,
the soul was a highway for processional shadows.
They have no names in language.
Only here and there one finds a thing said of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
them that is touched with recollection; their
voices are heard at times in blown drifts of
music; hints are given that it is not a solitary
experience.</p>

<p>Monthly or even more often thereafter Thaddeus
left his club and familiar pavements
behind him, and travelled up the Wyantenaug
Valley in a dull, noisy train, even through
that winter when the cold wind swept down
from Windless Mountain under the pines and
piled drifts more than commonly along the
Windless Mountain road. "Personally" he
took no interest in the columned avenues of
pines, the deep white ravine, the black, tinkling
stream, the groined architecture of ice. He
liked well enough the scents and balm of the
country spring, the lilacs and the hill winds
in summer, but he liked better his pavements
and club. It argued a highly enlightened
selfishness, a refined nicety of calculation,
such pains to be agreeable. If we charge
him with calculation, it is only to admire the
refinement of it, and refer the charge to his
doctrine. For if the confession that he was
secretly growing old meant that he foresaw
life would come presently to seem a little vacant,
without the intimate interest it once had, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
his house on Shannon Street be visited perhaps
by ghosts that would not always take
pains to be agreeable, it would seem to show a
skill in the pursuit of happiness, an eye for a
blind trail, not unworthy of the doctrine. To
foresee coming changes, what provision the
soul would need in a year or two more when
middle life was past and the strong pull of the
ebbing tide beginning to be felt, to disguise
from it the consequences of sixty years, and
so to persuade it gently, without force or argument,
to continue to idealize and feel agreeable,
were a fine bit of diplomacy. For it was
not merely a matter of carrying Helen away
to Shannon Street to start there a fresh stream
of interest, but Helen must take an interest
in him; they were to find each other lovable,
if the choicest result were to come; and Helen
was here somewhat difficult. The stream of
interest was started for him. He felt it strongly
when the first year was gone and Hamilton
was at its wintry busiest. But it was difficult
to be seen that she would pursue happiness
with consistency.</p>

<p>It was the spring of the year '60 when she
saw the green world once more, and summer
before she walked free of the garden. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
lilacs hung heavily and seemed almost to drip
with thick perfume. Thrush, oriole, and bobolink
were pursuing happiness and warbling
their success. Thaddeus was there, and chirped
in rivalry.</p>

<p>"But your mother would rather have something
to submit to."</p>

<p>"Oh no, Thaddeus," protested the widow,
mildly.</p>

<p>"You like the Lord to do you an injury.
It makes a pretty item on the balance-sheet."</p>

<p>"How can you say so?"</p>

<p>"My good sister!" Thaddeus raised despairing
hands. "You consist entirely of negatives.
There is no positive opinion that can
be attributed to you. I give you a character
and you deny it. You escape definition.
Personally, I doubt your existence. I believe
you're a myth."</p>

<p>Still the widow murmured, peacefully, "Oh
no, Thaddeus," knitting and rocking.</p>

<p>Thaddeus watched Nellie's face for signs of
happiness, and the widow denied with safety
and assurance. It was no trouble, except
to fit her denials to the form of the attack.
Thaddeus saw the loss of his rapier thrusts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of fine casuistry sometimes with passing irritation.</p>

<p>He went down to the post-office after supper,
to Mr. Paulus, the postmaster, one with whom
he had gone forth on such balmy evenings,
more than forty years past, and done things
from which their elders had inferred disastrous
careers. The postmaster was stout now, with
grizzled hair cut Quakerly, ponderously grave,
except that his left eyelid drooped and twitched.
It was the one place on his wide face where the
old spirit of demonry hinted of itself, and spoke
of the days of the consulship of Tad and Pete.
Without doubt the world was degenerate, and
had lost its breed of noble bloods. Alas, Tad
and Pete, once sworn and faithful, of one ideal
together; now each in the eyes of the other
was an exquisite absurdity, and all the young
were degenerate, except Nellie. "Pete, she's
doing well, poor little ghost, on my word."</p>

<p>"She'll bust out pretty soon then. Been
loadin' up now goin' on two year."</p>

<p>"I shall take her to Hamilton. She's a
racer, boy. Smacked you with a paint-brush!
God bless her! I should think she did. In
point of fact, it served you right. You roasted
Starr Atherton's litter of pigs yourself, I rec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>ollect
distinctly, and turned out a postmaster.
Respectable profession. I've nothing against
it."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to."</p>

<p>"Didn't mean to which? Fatheaded thing
to try to do anyhow. I told you&mdash;I precisely
stated the probable result. I said, any pig
of that size would squeal loud enough to wake
a congregation. And Starr Atherton was out
in the yard before he saw the fire, with a picture
in his mind already of himself pursuing Peter
Paulus, pig-stealer."</p>

<p>Mr. Paulus twitched his eyelid and reverted
to the other subject.</p>

<p>"Hamilton! Well&mdash;maybe she won't. She
might remember your position in society now.
She might gunpowder the mayor an' let it
go at that. What's in will out, that's what
I say&mdash;what's in will out. Now, as to paintin'
cats&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon! It is even said they
were not your cats."</p>

<p>"As to smackin' faces with paint-brushes&mdash;anybody
say it wasn't my face?"</p>

<p>Thaddeus leaned forward eagerly.</p>

<p>"What was the color?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;the paint was green, but there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
must've been some white on the brush. It appeared
to be streaked."</p>

<p>Thaddeus settled his glasses, rested his chin
on his cane, and studied the postmaster's face.
There were vast vacant spaces on it, where, it
seemed, one could keep on smacking green
paint a long while and not lose interest.</p>

<p>"What's in will out," repeated Mr. Paulus,
heavily. "What's in will out."</p>

<p>Up the hill as far as the church Thaddeus
thought of the post-office as compared to the
Wyantenaug Club, in what respects the post-office
had good points; from the church across
the sloping green, where in the dusk the pale
flowers glimmered against the grass, he thought
of Mr. Paulus's face smitten with paint; and so
of Nellie, a slim, white ghost, with eyes that
sometimes looked wistfulness after nameless
things, and sometimes seemed to watch only
the slow march of dreams. At the lilac gate
he stopped. Some one stood a moment squarely
in the little doorway, filling it with his shoulders,
then turned half back and leaned against the
jamb.</p>

<p>"Morgan Map, by&mdash;a-mm." The light shone
across the profile in the door. The Maps
were men of shoulders and stature, Morgan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the largest of the three; hair and brows of a
Celtic yellow with a glint of red in them, a
face of cliffs and caverns, bones of length
and massiveness. "Picts, Scots, Caractacus.
Vercingetorix," Thaddeus murmured. "My
education was faulty. It seems to me he
should be painted blue and carry a club."</p>

<p>He plucked a lilac and sniffed it, leaning
on the gate, looking at Morgan contemplatively
and at the placid knitting widow beyond.</p>

<p>"If I let that damned brute jockey me, it's
funny."</p>

<p>The militant church with its starward steeple
and weather-vane telling confidently to all
men which way the night winds of heaven
blew, the shining windows and doorways,
the scent of lilacs and the glimmer of white
flowers on the grass, the rounded billows of
the hills, Windless Mountain and the Cattle
Ridge dark against southern and northern
skies, the Four Roads, the meadows east where
one knew the Mill Stream was crooning to
itself&mdash;Hagar, by dusk at least, was much the
same as in the consulship of Tad and Pete,
now forty years later when Tad and Pete had
come to consider each other exquisite absurdities.
Even after another forty years, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
there any change in Hagar at dusk? You
cannot see how the charcoal-burners have cut
along the Cattle Ridge. Tad and Pete have
gone where one hopes for their sakes everything
is not a solemnity. But we were speaking
of Hagar when the night drops low, when the
hills seem to draw near and listen, and something
is said to the stars, which they admit,
about past and future being foolish endeavors
of language to say "now." There seems to
be a background and foreground everywhere.
And in the foreground things appear to be
hourly critical and important.</p>

<p>Morgan turned into the room and shut the
door. Thaddeus dropped the lilac promptly
and opened the gate.</p>

<p>"I seem to object to his shutting that door."
He walked up the garden path, tapping the
ground briskly with his cane, seeming to have
in mind things critical and important.</p>

<br />
<br /><small>Of Morgan Map and his Purposes</small></h2>

<p>Early frosts in October turned the maples
into pillars of fire; followed a long Indian summer,
hazy, even-footed, thoughtful days; as
if after making ready this ceremonial purple
and red and gold, gold brown of the meadows,
blue and gold of aster and golden-rod by roadsides
and meadow edges, veiled purple of the
sweet fern in high pastures, the year remembered
that it was not a pageantry of entry
and advance, but of departure, and walked
after the banners in recessional mood. In
November red and yellow leaves had flickered
past the windows and were raked into heaps
on the village green.</p>

<p>Helen kicked through the leaves, scattering
them with a dry rustle. "I'm as fit as can be. Morgan."</p>

<p>"Don't jump the fence."</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of it. It's the very thing."</p>

<p>"Wait."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>She stopped and looked at him.</p>

<p>"Better not," said Morgan, dryly. Helen
made a face, put one foot on the low rail of the
picket fence, jumped and plunged through
the lilacs, picked up her hat and swung into
the path. Morgan stood still outside the gate.
"Then you'll have to come out again and go
through."</p>

<p>His yellow eyebrows met over his eyes.
Helen flushed, hesitated&mdash;"Don't be an idiot,"
and then laughed. "I'll come if you don't
mind my thinking you're an idiot."</p>

<p>"I don't mind your saying you think
so."</p>

<p>She came outside the gate, looking interested.
Morgan leaned his back to its post
and smiled approval on Windless Mountain.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, because you don't think so. You
think I want you to do what I tell you. That's
very true; I do. Why shouldn't you?"</p>

<p>The question involved a series of other questions,
linked and secret. Helen fell to looking,
too, at Windless Mountain, which seemed to
be brooding as well over its constitutional
phenomena, whose causes were ages ago and
deep in the earth, its relations with other creat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>ures
such as winds, clouds, the regular and
the drifting stars.</p>

<p>She did do as Morgan said, whenever he
said anything; at least, she had almost always.
When one was Morgan and not a girl, and
seven years older, and able to dare all things
and do them&mdash;(to carry a person on his shoulder
miles, for instance, across the Cattle Ridge,
together with the game-bag, when a person was
tired, and begging not to be disgraced for a
baby, and would not have shed a tear for a
gold crown and a bushel of diamonds)&mdash;of
course it was right and necessary that such
a one should be worshipped and obeyed. Morgan
broke into her thoughts.</p>

<p>"Is it fixed when you go to Hamilton?"</p>

<p>"After Christmas. Do you know, I believe
uncle doesn't like you."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that's all right. I'll forgive him
till he feels better."</p>

<p>To fear nothing, to count no costs, to be
unlimited! The two years seemed as long
as lifetimes, since that summer when things
happened; and Morgan was still Morgan. He
had never cared who was angry with him,
or who liked or disliked him. Helen had
longed not to care and been bitterly driven to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
do so always. She struggled to imitate him.
In the face of sudden danger, attack of angry
game-preserver or owner of posted stream,
or any crisis of the woods when the partridge
whirred or the fox broke into the open, Morgan's
face would not flush nor his hand tremble;
but he only seemed to gather his brows
and centre himself on the subject, while little
Nellie wondered and worshipped. So he stood
for an ideal of effectiveness and freedom from
the tyranny of circumstances, which to her
small experience and large deduction seemed
visibly to bend aside before and around him,
from the tyranny of other people's opinions,
which he cared so little about that they turned
into harmless murmurs behind him instead of
planting themselves monumentally in front.</p>

<p>For at times this world appeared to exist
for opposition only, in iron battle order, bristling
with spears, stolid, reasonless, forbidding.
It was a caste system, a privileged aristocracy
of one's elders, the dead-line of an old r√©gime.
Morgan walked through it promptly. "People,"
he said, "pretend a lot more than they are,
most of 'em. My dad doesn't so much."</p>

<p>But freedom seems not to be an end in itself,
only an opportunity to do things differently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
It has its own r√©gime, its tyranny of devotions,
heroisms, and heroes, military, imperial.</p>

<p>That Morgan proposed a Napoleonic career
for himself&mdash;reasonably such, for he was no
dreamer&mdash;that he proposed to dominate, to
break through limits and oppositions, to drive
a path through the jam of men wide enough
for his shoulder muscles to work in, was merely
his own candid statement. And regarding
Thaddeus, his expression sprang equally from
candor. A man's dislike for him was a poor
reason for disliking that man. To carry malice
was to carry a load. A man was an engine
for covering ground and arriving at ends,
and malice was burned-out slack. Resentments
of old hostilities and memories of old
loves were slack, likes and dislikes mostly
whims. Mankind was various and whimsical,
and few were such as discarded futilities
and went on, which was lucky for the few.</p>

<p>"You're very sure of yourself, Morgan."</p>

<p>"Aren't you as sure of me, Nellie? You
used to be. Well," he said, slowly, "you see,
if Thaddeus Bourn tried to take a fall out of
me, he'd want to be subtle, and then it would
be all up with him, for I shouldn't understand
it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why should he want to take a fall out of
you?"</p>

<p>"If he doesn't, why should I mind his disliking
me?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you mind being disliked by anybody,
until they did something, really?"</p>

<p>"Not much."</p>

<p>"Oh! Not by me?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather be disliked by the United States.
Besides, that's foolish."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. It's funny, I have an
opinion of you that's miles long. It isn't
exactly an opinion, either."</p>

<p>Morgan smiled again with approval on
Windless Mountain.</p>

<p>"If you're going to be subtle I sha'n't understand
it," meaning possibly it was the
privilege of girls to have half-grown ideas
that they could not describe. A man had business
with only such as he could handle, put
to the use of resolve, statement, or persuasion.
If he was unable to express his mind completely,
it was because there was rubbish in
his mind. But between himself and Windless
Mountain, he did not object to Helen's having
an opinion of him that was not exactly an
opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Any one could have an understanding with
Windless, that eclectic philosopher, with his
feet deep in the earth, fertile loins, jovial belly,
the chest of a wrestler, and the gray, scarred
head of a prophet. On his flanks were chuckling
little rivulets, nesting birds, and all kinds
of flitting incident. From a distance you
might see his forehead lifted to abstractions,
pale-blue, spiritual things. Whatever you
said to him, he had an answer to your liking.
Whatever your philosophy, somewhere about
him he felt much the same. If you hated an
enemy, there was a trifle of ice, a certain ambient
glacier that once ground him badly, of
whom he had no loving remembrance and the
grooves whereof were on his bones. He was
no moralist. The liar and the thief could
find companionship there, the outcast existences
more deserted, the murderer note the
hawk risen red and screaming from the thicket,
and admit a spirit that bettered his own. Only
if you were not content in finding a likeness
in detail, and wished to look straight to his
scarred forehead, you would probably do well
to be candid and take your time. What you
got from him would be no special advice, but
an assurance that he understood you, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
would be something in his manner of understanding
that would meet the case and be
enough. If it was a moral influence, it lay in
bringing you to see the relations of things in
size and quality, and in making your own
directions more evident.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I like Windless best," said Helen, dreamily.
"He's the nicest person there is."</p>

<p>"It would be no joke to have him in your
way."</p>

<p>They turned into the garden and up the path
between brown, withered flower-beds.</p>

<p>"I jumped the fence, anyway, Morgan. It
would be idiotic to hurt myself. I won't do
it again."</p>

<p>"The point was, you didn't mind the colonel."</p>

<p>"I'm on a furlough. Take me up Windless
again."</p>

<p>"Not if you're on a furlough."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_IV" id="Chapter_IV">Chapter IV</a>
<br /><br />
<small>In which Thaddeus uses the term "Moral Justification"</small></h2>

<p>In the early days of Squire Map's seclusion
he had not yet made the hermit of himself that
Hagar was familiar with later. Men have
said that he never went outside the village
after the fall of '58, at least never to Hamilton.
The grooves where his bitterness ran plainly
deepened as the stream wore them year by
year; possibly the gradual noting how his withdrawal
made no empty place among busy men,
how feigning friends who had turned enemies
and rebellious sons went their way and prospered,
helped to widen and darken the shadow
of his misanthropy. He had been a lawyer,
a politician, and made his stir in his day. In
1860 he was a gray, grim gentleman in a long
coat and tall, black hat, with a caverned, bony
face and large frame, whom it was not considered
wisdom to address without good reason, but
who was seen often enough about the village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>And it was not so strange as to startle Widow
Bourn in her halcyon calm when he knocked
at her door one afternoon, and entered, doffing
his tall hat.</p>

<p>"I hope I don't disturb you, Mrs. Bourn."
The widow signified her unruffled comfort and
hoped he would sit down.</p>

<p>"With your permission, I will do so."</p>

<p>Followed a pause while the widow pursued
her knitting, and the squire's reddish, bushy
eyebrows drooped and gathered, while he studied
a patch of sunlight on the floor.</p>

<p>"I recollect that my son Morgan and your
daughter Nellie were once quite inseparable,
a companionship regarded as singular,
considering the difference in ages, not common
between a young man, approximately,
and a child. It was, however, I believe, a
fact."</p>

<p>"Morgan was always fond of Nellie."</p>

<p>The widow hoped secretly that, whatever
he intended to say, he would continue to put it
in the form of statements with which it was no
trouble to agree.</p>

<p>"I am told he has been here of late&mdash;in fact,
frequently."</p>

<p>That also was true. The widow wondered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
why people were afraid of Squire Map. He
was a very comfortable person to talk with.</p>

<p>"Sickness or misfortune is not, if I understand
his character, a thing that ordinarily
interests my son Morgan. I need not point
out to you that young people of a certain age
are apt to give much attention to the subject
of marriage."</p>

<p>The widow felt a twinge of discomfort. It
was but slight. She objected that Nellie was
young, hardly more than a child.</p>

<p>"In apprehension of the future, then, Mrs.
Bourn, I have to say that I doubt whether
any young woman will find the happiness
that is due her in such an intimate relation
with my son Morgan. I more than doubt it."</p>

<p>The widow dropped her knitting and stared
helplessly.</p>

<p>"That is perhaps all I have to say, Mrs.
Bourn. I apprehend something of the character
of your daughter Nellie. Her good looks
are remarkable, her disposition and intelligence
even more interesting. That may not
be my only motive in coming here. Whatever
the motive, I beg you to believe the warning
is entirely candid."</p>

<p>The widow felt herself in the shadow of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
vague distress, painfully called upon to say
something appropriate. She murmured that
Nellie was going to live with her uncle that
winter. The squire raised his hedge of eyebrows
suddenly.</p>

<p>"In Hamilton?"</p>

<p>With her uncle Thaddeus, the elder brother
of Simon. He had taken so much interest
in Nellie.</p>

<p>The squire mused. Yes. Could Mrs. Bourn,
if Mr. Thaddeus Bourn again visited Hagar,
contrive to suggest to him personally that
his former friend, Gerald Map, remembered him
with pleasure and would be under obligation
to Mr. Bourn if he, Mr. Thaddeus Bourn,
would call upon him, Gerald Map?</p>

<p>The squire then took his leave. He came
upon Morgan himself crossing the green with
his gun and hunting-dog. They faced each
other and stopped. Mr. Paulus from the post-office
below the hill observed them.</p>

<p>"Resemblin'," he remarked, "two rams
that's goin' to butt lightnin' out of themselves
in a minute."</p>

<p>"You still visit Hagar, then?" said the squire,
his voice muttering thunder.</p>

<p>"Quite often."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>The trick of the gathered eyebrows was
curiously common to both. The squire took
his time.</p>

<p>"You intend to marry Miss Helen Bourn?"</p>

<p>"I've been figuring on that for seven years.
You haven't found me changing my mind.
I intend to do it."</p>

<p>"I intend to prevent it, Morgan."</p>

<p>"In Nellie's interest, sir?"</p>

<p>"I regard it as in her interest."</p>

<p>"I mean, is that your interest in it?"</p>

<p>"I shall not say."</p>

<p>"I didn't feel encouraged to think it was an
interest in me. But it's natural to ask."</p>

<p>"Quite natural."</p>

<p>The squire walked a few steps, stopped and
looked back, his eyebrows drooping over their
melancholy caves. "I take no interest in
your success in any direction. I shall be
measurably interested in your failures. Whenever
you have a failure to report, and are inclined
to report it personally, I shall be glad
to see you."</p>

<p>"That's an odd offer, sir." Morgan swung
his gun over his shoulder. "I never saw any
real need of a row, and I don't yet. And I
don't pretend to understand the mixture now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>The squire went his way without answering.
Morgan looked after him, then at his hunting-dog
sniffing among the heaps of fallen leaves,
at Windless Mountain, and found nothing suggestive.
He walked slowly towards the Bourn
house.</p>

<p>Ordinarily a man spent his time better in
understanding his own purposes than the
purposes of other men. On the whole, they
were more easily thrust aside than understood.
That was Morgan's settled conviction
or characteristic. He did not mean to make
an exception in favor of the squire. At the
same time, "take an interest in your failures"
had an odd sound, and inviting him to come
and report them was a bit cool, if he only wanted
to gloat over them. Hardly in "dad's" style,
anyway. "Gloating" was a futile occupation.
The way the squire had taken that row
had been futile enough. But the question was
whether he could really do anything to make a
nuisance of himself. It not appearing how he
could, Morgan concluded to shake off the subject,
quickened his pace, and whistled to his dog.</p>

<p>Mr. Paulus remarked, despondently, from his
philosophic distance, "I most thought they'd
do some buttin'."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>His despondency led to reminiscence.
"Seems to me folks ain't so lively as when I
was a boy. The town's runnin' down."</p>

<p>He stood in his shirt-sleeves, though there
was a bleakness in the wind that hinted of
December. The bare branches of the maples
creaked, and the dead leaves fled up the road
in a whirl of dust.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was late in December when Thaddeus
came to Hagar again, a Hagar of gray, frozen
roads, little patches of dry, drifted snow, and
nights falling early. Mr. Paulus sat by a
lamp in the rear of the half-lit store, out of
sorts with rheumatism and by reason of human
nature. It was five o'clock. Thaddeus entered
with an air of happy secrecy, planted
himself, white-skinned, wrinkled, smiling, before
Mr. Paulus's red-and-round-faced gloom.</p>

<p>"Pete, I've been to see Gerald Map. Upon
my word! Singular interview, which I shall
not tell you anything about."</p>

<p>"Ain't no need," grumbled Mr. Paulus.
"Been agreein' on your epitaphs, an' it's about
time. Like to make epitaphs for all the danged
fools in town myself, an' fit the corpses to the
dates."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Thaddeus sat down carefully, and wiped
his glasses with snowy handkerchief, leaning
forward to the light; adjusted them, leaned
back, and rubbed his hands softly.</p>

<p>"Pete, when you've made up your mind
about something, it's a satisfaction to happen
on&mdash;a&mdash;unexpectedly&mdash;a moral justification of
it. It really is."</p>

<p>"Don't want one. Wouldn't have no use for
it. After those folks'd seen their epitaphs I'd
writ 'em, if they didn't do what was decent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A&mdash;I was referring," Thaddeus insinuated,
"to myself."</p>

<p>"You were!" Mr. Paulus reflected, dropped
his eyelid, and grew a shade more cheerful.
"Moral justification! Well&mdash;I caught Cummings's
boy stealin' plug tobacco th' other day.
An' he said he wanted it for Halligan. Guess
he did. Likely Halligan give him three cents
for a five-cent plug. He looked the picture of
virtue, anyhow; said he never chawed: he
wa'n't up to no such viciousness. Moral justification!
It's a good thing."</p>

<p>Thaddeus smiled absently, pursed his lips,
and was silent.</p>

<p>"Pete," he said at last, "how does green
paint feel?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Paulus's gloom faded away, and his interest,
his love of life, came gently back.</p>

<p>"Wet," he said, thoughtfully. "Gets stiff
after dryin'."</p>

<p>"Ah," murmured Thaddeus, "exactly."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few days later Helen and Thaddeus took
their way down the Wyantenaug Valley to
Hamilton, and left Hagar to the wintry hills
and Widow Bourn to her own manner of content.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_V" id="Chapter_V">Chapter V</a>
<br /><br />
<small>Introducing Hamilton and Saint Mary's Organ</small></h2>

<p>Hamilton took its name from a little English
hamlet. The statesman was a coincidence.
It lies in a bend of the Wyantenaug River,
which hardly ripples on the piers of its docks,
ten miles from the sea and at the head-water
of the river's navigation. Its colonial memories
gather about the Common where the
first settlers built their church and cluster
of shingled houses, and about the docks where
ships from the South Seas used to come in at
flood-tide, from the capes and the Indian Ocean,
from the West Indies and from England, whalers,
too, and many fishing-smacks. The Common
is half a mile from the docks. The old church
stands in the centre of it. Century elms and
oaks are scattered about, not planted in regular
rows; but wherever it had seemed to be a
good place for a tree, there the tree had grown.
On the south side, or Main Street, are the courthouse
and city hall; on the east side, or Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Street, are the Constitution and Wyantenaug
clubs and a church with twin steeples; on the
north side, or James Street, square brick and
stuccoed residences, with lawns, and sometimes
a silent fountain or solitary marble
statue, such as that dancing faun which appears
to dislike its occupation; on the west
side, or Academy Street, there are stores and a
hotel, but farther up Academy Street are the
law-school buildings, farther still the academy
itself, founded in the reign of William and
Mary, where from of old the Latin declensions
were learned with the aid of a ferule and curiously
called "humane letters."</p>

<p>All the flat, green meadows that once stretched
west and south from near by the Common as
far as the river are filled with brick blocks
and industry now&mdash;stores, factories, and tenements.
Two railroads run in subways to the
station and bridge at the bend in the river.
Jamaica, India, and Academy streets follow
the old meadow roads, along which merchants
in tie-wigs used to drive leisurely to the docks,
where a leisurely ship or two would be lying,
and there examine their consignments. North
and east of the Common in the angle between
Main and Academy streets lies the section in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
which those for the most part used to live who
maintained mahogany tables and were able to
exercise choice as to where they would live.
Shannon Street runs from the northwest
corner of the Common diagonally northeastward,
crossing three irregular openings, miscalled
squares, where muddles of streets came
together, and monuments have been erected
to commemorate two wars and a distinguished
judge. It ends in Temple Square, which
marks its exclusiveness, and at the same time
admits the aristocracy of Shannon Street by
having no other entrance than Shannon Street.
The houses about the square are much alike,
stuccoed, severe, with small porches, pillars,
and iron fences close to the sidewalk. The
centre of the square has a high iron fence about
it, gates with scrollwork, which are commonly
shut.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The house of Thaddeus faced on Philip's
Road and Shannon Street, not far from the
monument to the War of 1812, the two streets
meeting at dull angles in front. There was
more of it on Philip's Road, but it was numbered
with Shannon Street, because to live on
Shannon Street was a better principle. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
street signs of Philip's Road at different times
had been changed to "Pequot Avenue," with
a view to euphony and a securer social position,
but the commissioners were not persistent
enough, and nature was against them.
The name hinted it once to have been an Indian
trail, or at least that some person had said so;
and whether this person was truthful and
informed was forgotten, too. The chronicles
but mentioned the tradition. The road showed
a certain furtive vagrancy, running from the
theatre at the corner of the fair grounds barbarously
and disorderly through two blocks,
otherwise of a shape without reproach, and
shying away from the law school&mdash;an instinct
of untamed nature. It approached Shannon
Street gradually with sullen suspicion, caught
sight of the monument of 1812, plunged suddenly
across, ran riot through a number of
blocks, and escaped into the open country. So
that Thaddeus's house was numbered on Shannon
Street.</p>

<p>Charles Street ran by it on the west, and so
past Saint Mary's Church directly to the Common.
Helen looked first from the west window
of her room on Charles Street and saw bare
boughs of maple-trees shining in the cold moon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>light,
and across the way a long row of glimmering
vestibules and curtains; then from
the south window, and saw a house with a
large, glowing window beyond a vacant space
of lawn, over it the apse at the rear of a church,
with two small steeples, and farther on and up
the big steeple and gilded cross glittering in
the mist of the moon. A lady walked past
and past the glowing window. The room
within looked warm, mellow, peaceful, but
she seemed restless. Once she stopped and
even seemed to gaze up at Helen, but her face
was in shadow. Helen thought she was tall
and had thick hair.</p>

<p>Some one was playing the organ in Saint
Mary's, a sombre mutter and deep breathing
underneath, wild voices calling and crying
above. More voices gathered; they struggled,
strained, shrieked reproach, and wailed for
pity, till one by one they were hushed and
only the measured breathing went on.</p>

<p>In the morning Thaddeus said: "You've
done very well. I've heard that the two things
most worth while in Hamilton now are to see
Mrs. Mavering and hear Gard Windham's
playing. Personally&mdash;" Thaddeus poised his
coffee-cup, "as regards Mrs. Mavering, I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
that to be correct. As regards the other, it
has sometimes seemed to me that it was not
exactly&mdash;a&mdash;civilized; that, in point of fact,
it appeared to be at times&mdash;it might be said
to be at times&mdash;a kind of description of society
among the fallen angels&mdash;an objectionable
subject for comment so public, I should say,
distinctly. It appears, I might say, to lack
restraint&mdash;a&mdash;good taste. I seem to see a person
in impossible garments dancing on the
roof of Saint Mary's with great impatience,
and stating his distress in strong language.
Personally, therefore, I wish Gard Windham
would keep his spectres out of my back yard,
and&mdash;my dear Helen! I beg of you, don't look
at me in such a&mdash;a&mdash;vast manner. Mr.
Windham is considered a remarkable musician."</p>

<p>"I saw him too, Uncle Tad."</p>

<p>"On my word! Where?"</p>

<p>"On the roof. He was acting that way you
said."</p>

<p>"Well, bless my soul!"</p>

<p>Thaddeus walked down-town thoughtfully.
"She'll run off after one of Gard Windham's
ghosts the next thing. No more than likely.
She has an imagination that's as honest as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the bank and the finest pair of eyes, my word,
in Hamilton."</p>

<p>In the afternoon Morgan came with his
trotting stallion, Consul, and drove her by
Philip's Road to the fair grounds to show his
paces on the track. The day was cold, dry,
blue, and still, but on the track the speed made
a rush of air against her face. The fair
grounds were empty, the track with a patch
of snow here and there, the stands staring from
thousands of empty seats.</p>

<p>The great horse lengthened his stride. He
was all power and ease. Such controlled
crescendo of speed seemed to mean deep reserves.
There was a thrill in the sense of
those reserves.</p>

<p>"Do you like it, Nellie?"</p>

<p>"It's glorious!"</p>

<p>"Of course you like it. Hold hard."</p>

<p>"You're the right stuff, Nell," he said at
Thaddeus's door.</p>

<p>Morgan's commendations of her had always
been rare enough to be thrilling. Her head
sang with "Morgan, Morgan," the victorious,
the controlling. The sound of Consul's hoofs,
the rush of wind in her face, the flying objects,
had been only expressions of the beat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
rush of his will. The sense of him was overwhelming.
It surprised her to find that Thaddeus
appeared smaller than ordinary, more
frail and artificial. He seemed to be chattering
things without significance. It was the contrast
with Morgan's immense genuineness
and direct speech, and because to have one's
mind filled with Morgan was to be forced imperiously
to look at things in Morgan's way,
which was an absolute way. It brought one
to despise decorations, mannerisms, whatever
did not come to the point and justify itself;
to summon all vague emotion and half-formed
ideas of one's own to pay their way or admit
bankruptcy and disappear; to expect other
people to meet one with the same solidity of
surface. Conversation, according to Morgan,
which consisted of an exchange of intuitions,
was a kind of inflated currency; the bulk of it
was irredeemable; there might be a bullion
fact or two behind, but to try to do business
on the basis of it was futile. A man might
either pay good coin or counterfeit for purposes
of his own, but why play ducks and drakes
with himself? Thaddeus Bourn, by an odd
inconsistency, was a business man of some
acumen, who outside of that chose to pretend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
to be a child with strings of beads, and had
nothing visible to gain by it. A sentimentalist
was the most irritating of men, who wasted his
time pretending to be more of a fool than he was.</p>

<p>So that Helen became engaged in judging
Thaddeus severely, silently, under Morgan's
principles.</p>

<p>"Helen," said Thaddeus, using an interpretative
eye-glass, "permit me to say you're
exceedingly young, delightfully young. I am
pleased that you enjoyed your drive. Our
friend Morgan is an interesting barbarian. In
course of time, no doubt, you will see the advantages
of civilization."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Uncle Tad?" she said,
pursuing cash values.</p>

<p>"There is a kind of barbarism," continued
Thaddeus, "which refuses to be civilized, and,
in point of fact, eats the missionary. It finds
the missionary in that capacity good, and
goes its way with&mdash;with congratulation. It is
striking; really, there is an impressive simplicity
about it; but, dear me, you know it will
never do. It's a little&mdash;isn't it a little obtuse?
At least, my dear&mdash;at least, one might be allowed
to doubt whether&mdash;it does not seem so,
personally, to the missionary."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Thaddeus could hardly have hoped to dissipate
any dominant sense of Morgan from
Helen's mind with such fugitive sayings.
He was probably testing, considering. "We
are all egoists, my dear, except a few women.
Morgan is the primitive and aboriginal egoist.
He is&mdash;a&mdash;aggressive, carnivorous. I am a
social egoist; your father, who wished, with
emphasis, to be remembered, was, pardon me,
a regretful egoist; your mother is a contented
and unaggressive egoist. And so every one
has, so to speak, a class. It is no reproach;
it is nature, my dear&mdash;law. Why pretend to
escape? But," he concluded, with grace and
precision, "there is a choice, and in matters
of choice I always take pleasure in pointing
out to you the advantages of civilization."</p>

<p>Morgan still headed the march of Helen's
dreams. The same moon, a little fuller than
the night before, laying a thicker wash of
silver, hung over the apse of Saint Mary's.
She looked from her window at the roofs where
the organ player's spectre had seemed to be
dancing then, mistily, wildly, to the storm of
sound below. The friendly window was dim,
which the lady had walked past and past,
restless, tall, thick-haired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>How strong and wonderful was Morgan!
What more could there be under the moon
and stars than the will to dare and the power
to do? Helen had no name for the spell. Only
of late had she thought of it in detail. In old
times the word "Morgan" itself expressed
the whole subject. It described the beginning
and the end of things.</p>

<p>The organ began to breathe somewhere behind
the stained windows that were just glimmering.
It seemed to be laying the foundations
of its temple of sound on the undermost
bed-rock. Now it was lifting the walls, and
one gathered and knew gradually how vast
was the weight of the masonry; how the power
beneath that raised it foot by foot was vaster
still; how sure of itself was the power beneath,
for certainly it only used one hand to force that
steady climb of masonry; the other ran along,
chiselling designs, gargoyles, pale statues in
niches, sweeping a series of half-circles and
filling them with deep-sea and warmest sunset
color till, lo! it was a rose window.</p>

<p>Helen breathed fast, pressing her face to the
cold pane. Something here, too, was strong!</p>

<p>She snatched a cloak, sped through halls,
down stairs, through more halls and a back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
door, out into the moonlit yard. There was
only a low iron fence to jump, and she was
under the curve of the apse. A door stood half
open in the corner where it joined the main
building, and within was a swing-door which
yielded noiselessly. It was quite dark there
under the gallery, but a few gas-lights flickered
in the chancel and shone on lower ranges of
gilded organ-pipes, banked away beyond in a
kind of transept, and on a choir screen that hid
the organist. A few dusky figures could be
made out sitting in pews here and there in the
nave. Helen crept into a seat next a stone
pillar that felt rugged and cool, and was pushed
forward partly into the pew.</p>

<p>The building of the temple had ceased, its
visionary masonry, carvings, and rose window
vanished at a touch withdrawn. The organ
was murmuring down among the old foundations
of the world, communing with the beginnings
of time, meditating to rise out of the deep
with a new creation. Otherwise the church
was so still that the air seemed heavy with the
stillness.</p>

<p>A multitude of fleeting, flickering sounds
broke out, like a burst of fireworks, the air full
of shooting-stars, blown bubbles, and tinsel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
There was a piping and dancing in the sunlight
on delicate meadow grass, by pipers and dancers
who could not conceivably grow old. Then
a voice spoke suddenly among them. One
could not tell where it came from or what it
said. It was cold, sombre, indifferent. But
it ceased and the dancing went on, more bacchanal
now. There were perfumes, garlands
on hot foreheads, shrieking and whirring of
stringed instruments, high laughter, and swinging
in circles. The loud, cold voice spoke
again, and left no echoes or after-murmurs.
Something more quiet followed, as if the memory
of fear could not be quite put away, or remained
in the form of an altered mood. People
walked hand-in-hand. There was warm
twilight and the ripple of a flowing river.
After all, life was sweeter for seriousness, love
best in the stillness and twilight. The cold,
insistent voice rose, a stone pillar of sound,
and all these things became complaining ghosts
before its weightier reality. So that at length
and in the end it remained alone, except for
the mutter in the pit below, and there was no
triumph in its victory, but it continued cold,
sombre, indifferent, monotonous, heavy.</p>

<p>Some one beyond the pillar sighed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
darkness, and a hand fell on Helen's hand
which gripped the edge of the seat. Helen
started and whispered, "Oh, that was hateful!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>"He plays like anything, but&mdash;" She came
out of her absorption to know that she had
been whispering her thoughts into the darkness,
and that the darkness had given forth
an apology. A shadow the other side of the
little stone pillar seemed to be leaning forward
now and looking at her. A dress rustled.</p>

<p>"The music was sad, was it not?" and Helen
whispered again:</p>

<p>"They tried all sorts of ways, and tried and
tried, but it never was any use, and they gave
up and died."</p>

<p>"Did it seem so clear? He's beginning
again."</p>

<p>It was a kind of nocturne or slumber song,
a rocking movement with a flute tone moving
through a dimmer mist of harmonies, soothing
here and there a restless chord. "Has He
not made the night for your slumber, and
darkened the earth for your sleep, and lit the
earth softly with stars, and moved it among
them as a child's cradle is rocked? Wake, then,
if you may not sleep, but only to watch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
moon rising and hear the croon of the sea.
Murmur and motion, motion and murmur; but
remember wonder, remember beauty, and let not
anything persuade you from them. A moon
and a sea be in your heart, a hush of an inner
place. <i>Ora pro nobis</i>, and for the growth
of flowers on ancient graves. <i>Requiescant
in pace</i>, souls stately and dead. If the truth
is a dream, then the dream is true, and
therefore He made the night for your slumber,
and darkened and lit the earth and moved it
softly among stars, and gave to the moon its
rising and to the sea its motion and murmur."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They went out by the swing-door together,
passed from the shadow of the apse to the level
yard, and stopped.</p>

<p>"I think your name is Helen Bourn," said
the other. "Mine is Rachel Mavering. You
will come to see me often. We are so near."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_VI" id="Chapter_VI">Chapter VI</a>
<br /><br />
<small>Introducing Gard Windham and the Brotherhood
of Consolation</small></h2>

<p>One warm, rainy evening in the year '44,
and in the great city that is flanked on either
side by a river and a strait, Father Andrew
plodded along an avenue of small shops, whose
windows rested their chins on the wet sidewalk
and blinked through steaming panes.
His dingy umbrella dripped in the rain, and
the skirts of his robe flapped against his white
stockings. He had in his mind no more than
presently the opening of the door in the brick
wall of a cloister court, the sleepy roll of the
vesper service, refection, complines, a little
private, companionable prayer, such as ever
seems to be heard kindly if one is trustful,
and then the sleep which comes to tired saint
and sinner alike with singular tolerance. Alas!
one's fat legs became tired enough with climbing
stairways, and the soul sore with its
strained sympathies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>A lean, wet-haired boy, plodding past him,
glanced up with large, drowsy-lidded eyes,
and slid under his broad umbrella, making
no comment. Father Andrew chuckled and
sighed. Giving and taking were a simple incident,
if giving were merely to carry an umbrella
for two, taking merely to step under it,
and charity were not charity but companionship.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go with you," after hesitating.</p>

<p>"But where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"Lappo's."</p>

<p>"And where's Lappo?"</p>

<p>"I don' know. He's dead."</p>

<p>Father Andrew chuckled and sighed again.
Very likely he could not have decided himself,
from any earthly information, where Lappo
was. "Was it Lappo the fruit-seller? Yes,
yes. And what is your name?"</p>

<p>"Gard Windham."</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;Well, well! A&mdash;mm&mdash;And Lappo
wasn't your father? Who was?"</p>

<p>"I don' know."</p>

<p>"Anybody know?"</p>

<p>"I guess they don't."</p>

<p>"Well, what&mdash;that is, dear me! You don't
say so! I mean, where'd he get you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Got me to the Foundlings. Lappo"&mdash;speaking
in the way of quiet conversation&mdash;"Lappo
had fits."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Ga&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gard Windham."</p>

<p>Father Andrew fell to patting one fat hand
on the back of the other, which gripped the
umbrella. It was his habit to pat one hand
softly over the other whenever he was giving
himself advice, or found himself driven to some
conclusion which could not be soothed or softened
by any more logical method. "Yes, yes.
Dear me!" A life probably of unsanctioned
origin. It was apt to be the reason for the
closed door and the lost key.</p>

<p>They came to the door in the brick wall,
and went from the street that murmured sadly
with the rain, into the little paved court that
murmured sadly with the rain.</p>

<p>Then Father Andrew sat down before the Father
Superior, whose black eyes glowed and
dreamed, and felt himself like a small particle
of dust, happy in its humility.</p>

<p>"It is as you say," said the Superior. "A
door is closed behind it. Consecration is sometimes
the more complete."</p>

<p>Father Andrew murmured that it was, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
thought of the refectory and a salad he knew
of with peppers in it. He was used to thinking
of salads when he should not be thinking
of them. He was sorry for it, and knew that
he had no claim to anything but humility.</p>

<p>"The face promises and threatens," mused
the Superior. "How often is it that the highest
that is spiritual is based on the strongest that
is worldly."</p>

<p>The Superior was a man of symbols and
analogies, swarthy of skin and large of frame,
one whose conceptions came red from their
furnace. Father Andrew's mind was nestled
the rather in a certain padded placidity. Moreover,
there was the salad, with its peppers.
No doubt, if the Superior saw promises of a
more than common consecration, and threatenings
of peculiar importance in this young
person without origin, it was a thing to be expected
of the Superior's holy and profound
discernment. The Superior's spiritual enterprise
was ever extraordinary. He was of such
as had from the beginning fought in the vanguard
of the Church, and been her glory and
adornment. For himself, Father Andrew discerned
little further than to feel that his duty of
distributing the brotherhood's charities would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
be easier if every one had the young person's
native assurance. He felt that Providence,
clearly with a purpose, had bestowed upon
himself such limited insight wherewith to be
content. It enabled him at least to admire
the Superior without limit. He went his way
to the salad and the peppers, and Gard remained
in the house of the Brotherhood of
Consolation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a Catholic order, somewhat quiet in
its ways. Not many of the brothers were like
the Superior, whose faith was a yearning in
the blood as fiery as young love, and for whom
night-long struggles of prayer appeared to be
a normal way of living. For the most part
they seemed to be elderly men, keeping the
rule without any apparent effort, but rather
as something it would be an effort to vary
from. Probably they were happier than most,
in the shuffle of fate, manage to be. It would
be difficult to show they were not. The monastery
bell clinked at small intervals of the
day and night, and slippered feet were ever
going whispering down the corridors on the
heels of the sliding moment, to place some
office of performance or prayer accurately in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
little division of time. And this method and
regulation of hours, so old, so grown from
measureless experience and minute knowledge
of humanity, seemed to be a kind of setting or
framework to keep in place, till their times
came, the souls for whom atonement was accomplished;
or for the others, to keep the saving
of their souls in orderly process of accomplishment.
The faces of all except the Superior
looked something alike. They broke easily
into smiles, but laughter seldom went beyond
a happy chuckle.</p>

<p>The window of Gard's little cell looked over
the court against the face of a dead wall that
ended a block of uniform houses. The cloister
covered two of the remaining sides, a brick
wall ten feet high the fourth, and a thick wooden
door led through this into the street. The
court was asphalted, except for a strip under
the dead wall, where one Brother Francis
planted things hopefully every spring, and
found entertainment all summer in the ill-advised
efforts they made to grow.</p>

<p>It was Francis who taught Gard his Latin
accidents, and later the writings of those dignified
heathen, C√¶sar and Tullius Cicero; later
still his Greek, in which language appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the writings of one Herodotus, and of others
called "Fathers of the Church," of whom
he might disbelieve Herodotus if he chose&mdash;an
unnecessary distinction; he believed them all
fervently. One of his vivid memories was the
delivering before brothers Francis and Andrew,
with violence and tears, the oration, "Tandem
aliquando, Quirites," with indignation because
both chuckled without intermission, and would
not see the importance of condemning Catiline.
Francis had general charge of the monastery
school, which was filled and emptied daily
through a special door on the avenue. But
the scholars seldom went further than reading
and writing, sums and fractions, and the lives
of those saints who had had the more interesting
adventures; so that, under the Superior's
permission, to lead Gard into these high places
of learning was a pleasure to which Francis
surrendered himself, he feared, with sinful
abandonment.</p>

<p>Music, Gard studied with one Brother Johannes,
who played the little organ in the whitewashed
chapel, all white except by the altar,
where there was a distinction of gilded woodwork,
silver candlesticks, and purple cloths,
and so cold in winter that one's fingers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
numb on the keys. He was an old, bowed-over
man, Johannes, with frail, waxen hands,
absent-minded, apt to forget his rule and be
late, and not understand why the Superior persisted
in modifying his discipline. He feared
the Superior estimated his sins too lightly, and
died in the year '52, when Gard was seventeen.
Gard had to play the organ at offices after
that, and to go daily three blocks up the avenue
to the church of the Sacred Trinity, and take
his lesson from Fritz Moselle, a mighty German
from Strassburg, near the Rhine. He learned
many things besides harmony and counterpoint
of Fritz, who was a cosmopolitan, and believed
not in the faith of man or woman; but he believed
that art was the one country of the soul,
and that in conduct it was the duty of every
one to "do as he <i>verdammt</i> please."</p>

<p>"Look you, <i>kleiner</i>! In de mass&mdash;yes.
Some monk he haf art in him&mdash;Gott, yes! He
found a place for his soul to live in. He know
diese vorldt was a circus, und he vas a lil' boy
und can't go. He mus' stay to home. Ach!
he feel sad. Und by-and-by he compose music
to a circus in hefen, vich vas de mass you
play yesterday. Aber you mus' play de Bach
fugue severe. Maybe you make a good monk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
but you haf too much luxury in your bones to
play de Bach fugue, <i>hein</i>? No? Play den,
p'tit anchorite, und let each of your fingers be
von of de Ten Commandments, or Gott! you
don' play him not any." The organ at Trinity
was quite another matter than the little one
which wheezed plaintively in the brotherhood's
whitewashed chapel.</p>

<p>Once a week he had to go to the Superior
and be examined, and probably read a chapter
of St. Augustine. It was a ceremony of indefinite
length, for the Superior sometimes fell
into a monologue, fervid as St. Augustine's,
while walking to and fro; and Gard used to
imagine the room full of spirits and misty
angels, listening&mdash;all of them&mdash;breathless, astonished,
and a little frightened; for there
could not be any one who was not afraid of the
Superior, unless it were the <i>bonus Deus</i>, and
even He must be astonished. At length the
great, swarthy man would lay his hand on
Gard's head&mdash;a large hand, lean and strong,
and vibrating with the throb and blast of the
furnace that was in him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Infinite and Tender, if it is needed for
the saving of this young soul, send him sorrow
and pain, and let his grief be deep." And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Gard would come away tingling like the bells of
Trinity, which had a chime of twenty, and it
made the bell-tower rock to play them hard.
He never after lost the impression that those
interviews, of all kinds of human experience,
probably most resembled death and resurrection,
and things likely to happen at the gate of the
celestial city. He grew to something over a
medium, slim height at this time, had drowsy
eyelids, and wakeful gray eyes under them.
He laughed with a bass voice, liked brothers
Francis and Andrews, and Fritz Moselle, and
worshipped the Superior, but preferred to
dodge him. The preference was probably a
sin, one which Brother Francis claimed to
have prayed for in himself some twenty years
without effecting. He discovered that the
Superior, Francis, and Fritz Moselle had each
severally a distinct point of view, and that
you could tell beforehand in what direction
their interpretations of anything would point.
He found that he liked the organ in Trinity
better than Cicero, and watching the throng
of men and women, with bright colors in their
hats, as he went to and from the brotherhood
and Trinity, if not better, at least differently,
than either. And in the year '55 he discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
that he was expected presently to take the
vows, and awoke to the further fact that the
idea filled him with melancholy. It resembled
to him a sandy desert, with not an
oasis in sight, not a palm-tree against the
sky.</p>

<p>The children who followed the piper of Hamelin,
the mariners of Odysseus who cocked their
ears to the sirens, and other harkers to such
instrumental enchantment, have reported experiences
that are much alike. They heard,
it seems, a high, thin fluting, ineffably sweet,
which seemed to imply that just beyond those
blue hills, or those white breakers, or a few
turns of the next street, there lay an extraordinary
region overrun with smiling probabilities;
for there, whatever one dreamed of
most was more than likely to be found, whether
it was sugar-plums, or a girl in the brake with
sunny hair, or a sword and shield, and a banner
to follow withal.</p>

<p>But when Gard told Father Andrew that he
would not take the vows, Father Andrew acted
as if it were a new thing, and lifted his
fat hands helplessly.</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;A&mdash;Dear me! That is, I mean
why not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he patted Gard's hand with his soft
palm, and chuckled and sighed.</p>

<p>"But it's true," Gard said. "I'll tell you
why."</p>

<p>"The blessed&mdash;I mean, don't! Tell the
Superior." And he scuttled away in alarm,
murmuring, "I wish that boy didn't surprise
me so."</p>

<p>It had not occurred to Gard, but evidently he
must tell the Superior; and how could the
Superior be made to understand about the
high fluting, and that it said "Follow, follow,"
so that one needs must go; and all about the
sugar-plums and the girl in the brake, and the
banner and sword and shield? And, if not,
what was there to tell the Superior, more than
to make a bare statement of his rooted ingratitude,
his incorrigibly evil nature, and his
resolve to go? Probably there was not another
such case in the history of orders, and he
would be excommunicated. He knew the
Superior had meant him to be peculiarly consecrated,
and, because he had no origin back of
the Foundlings' Hospital, had thought him a
soul only the better fitted to be seized and sent
heavenward powerfully. What right had he
to interfere with the Superior's great purpose?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Nevertheless, he set his mouth and knocked on
the familiar door.</p>

<p>The Superior was pacing the room, as his
habit was. It was a long, gray-walled room,
containing a few chairs, a picture of the Annunciation,
a writing-table with a crucifix over it,
a bookcase with, by Gard's frequent counting,
one hundred and twelve books, leaving out the
controversial pamphlets. It was flooded with
light from three large windows. The floor
was uncarpeted.</p>

<p>Gard entered on the subject promptly.</p>

<p>"I've found I can't take the vows, father.
I'm afraid you'll never forgive me."</p>

<p>The Superior stopped short; a spasm of pain
crossed his face. Gard thought, "Now it's
coming."</p>

<p>"Do I seem to you unforgiving?" he said,
sadly. "Do you know, that sin of mine was
pointed out to me thirty years ago, when I was
your age. I imagined it was conquered. I'm
afraid I have not watched for it of late
years."</p>

<p>Gard was dumb with surprise. The Superior
resumed his pacing.</p>

<p>"I have been hoping that you would come
to me in this way of your own will. You will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
think it best, then, to leave the brotherhood&mdash;at
least for a time? Have you any
plans?"</p>

<p>"I would play in some church, father.
There is Fritz Moselle."</p>

<p>"Moselle? Yes, your teacher. A curious
instance. I remember him. Made up of a
thousand fragments, shivered pieces of glass,
from what have been faiths and systems of
philosophy, and have had, perhaps, in their
time a certain fragile beauty. He probably
uses such terms as 'art' and 'cosmopolitanism'
in connection with it. A curious,
modern type. You will learn by observing
such." There was a pause. Gard began to
collect himself.</p>

<p>"When I said for a time," went on the Superior.
"I meant that my hopes and your issues
are in His hands, where they belong. You
will write to me if you are in need."</p>

<p>He stood still a moment.</p>

<p>"There is one result of experience for one
soul and another for another. 'As often as I
have gone forth among men I have returned
home less a man,' saith St. Thomas √† Kempis;
but the spirit of our time does not speak in
this way. I suppose"&mdash;smiling&mdash;"it is only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
young men who really hear what the spirit of
the time says."</p>

<p>He put his hands on Gard's bowed head, and
there was a long silence. Then Gard stammered
something, and presently&mdash;somehow&mdash;got
away and stood in the corridor alone. His
eyes were full of blinding tears, and yet there
was a sense of wild relief. The interview was
over, and he had never seen the Superior so
mild, so politely talkative.</p>

<p>The parting with the rest of the brotherhood
was more of an ordeal. Brothers Andrew and
Francis kissed his cheek and turned away.
It seemed to him they looked suddenly old, and
gray, and broken.</p>

<p>The cold, white corridor was full of ghosts of
his own past hours and days staring reproachfully.
He passed out through the cloister
court, carrying his little bundle under his arm.
The asphalt was wet with the mist. Francis's
flower-bed had only a few crooked, brown,
uncannily-shaped stalks, like dry mummies'
hands thrust through the mould and clutching
blindly. He opened the door in the brick wall
of the court. The hinge was worn and the gate
had been sagging lately. It grated as he closed
it behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_VII" id="Chapter_VII">Chapter VII</a>
<br /><br />
<small>Introducing Moselle and Mavering</small></h2>

<p>It was yet early in the afternoon. There
was a hint of the sun overhead, a semi-luminous
space in the thin mist, though the pavements
were still wet. The two opposite currents of
flowing humanity on the avenue mingled and
jostled and dodged, with haste and with leisure,
with good-humor and petulance.</p>

<p>The avenue as far as Trinity, and Gard in his
black robe, knew each other very well. The
policeman had nodded to him kindly for years,
and of late had taken to touching his helmet.
The avenue did not appear to see anything
peculiar about him now, but it came to him with
a shock, so that he knew of a certainty that
the relations between them were quite changed.
The policeman touched his helmet, the man at
the newspaper booth his hat, but that was a
mistake. Properly, he ought to stop and tell
them it was a mistake, that he had put off
consecration, declined reverence, and cast his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
lot with them and the avenue's democracy.</p>

<p>The sexton of Trinity was sweeping the steps.
He took off his cap when Gard stopped to ask
him where Moselle lived. "Two streets up,
riverence," he said, "an' turn to your left;
number sixty-siven, on'y it's rubbed out,
riverence. Is it a bit o' music you're carryin',
sor?"</p>

<p>Gard found where sixty-seven was rubbed
out on a street door, and under direction climbed
three narrow flights, to a narrow, top-story hall,
with a skylight overhead and several doors,
one with the grimy card of Fritz Moselle tacked
upon it. He knocked. "<i>Herein!</i> Come! Veil,
<i>du lieber Himmel</i>! It's de lil' anchorite!"</p>

<p>The room which Moselle came storming
across seemed to have been originally three
rooms, but the partitions had been mainly
cut away. There were two pianos, and two
grates for coal fires. Floor and chairs and
tables were a welter of sheet-music, beer-bottles,
steins, books, flower-pots, cats, pipes,
newspapers, and rumpled rugs. Moselle came
through it like a loose meteor, bent on breaking
chaos into smaller fragments; hair brushed
back and yellowish, dingy with age, eyebrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and mustache that swelled and dropped like
cataracts, weight to threaten floors, huge, fat
fist, and porcelain pipe in mouth. He hugged
Gard to his mighty belly, muttered and puffed
hoarsely, and pulled him across the room to
where a man in black had risen from his chair,
who had a long jaw and aggressive chin, shaven
bluish, a slouched hat on his head, a frock-coat,
and was tall, gaunt and bony. He held out
his hand.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to know you, Mr. Windham,"
he said, in a deep, drawling voice, with a certain
winningness of smile.</p>

<p>"'Tis Shack Mavering. He knows about
you, <i>kleiner</i>," cried Moselle, boisterous, explanatory.
"'Tis a friend of Mephisto, der
Faust-devil, und of me. Ha! Sit down. Vat
iss dat?" pointing to Gard's bundle.</p>

<p>Gard dropped his bundle beside his chair.
At the brotherhood was orderly calm, thoughtful
silence, cool, clear walls, and whispering
sound of slippered feet. Moselle at organ
lessons in Trinity had never seemed so loose
and free, broad, joyous, unlimited. Somehow
Gard felt as if vacant spaces about his soul
were growing warm and inhabited. He laughed,
and knew no reason for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've left the brotherhood. I'm going to
be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gott! Vat you going to be?"</p>

<p>Gard laughed again.</p>

<p>"I thought you might know, and if you did
you'd be sure to tell me."</p>

<p>"So!" Moselle's face, when it dropped vivacity
and took on gravity, fell into rugged,
powerful lines. "Got no money?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nor clothes of a human too much, nor plans,
nor friends but old Fritz, nor knowledge of perversity?
Good! All good! You will stay mit
old Fritz some veek or more, und I vill get
you a church-organ to play somevere. Good!
<i>Hein?</i> Shplendid! Shack!"&mdash;gesticulating
over Gard&mdash;"look you at his head, his eyelid,
his shape of der hair-line. Vat? It is super-sensuous
Florentine, und de back of his head
is Yankee, und so hard you not break him mit
an axe. I say in all human variety is law, und
device, und chain of causes, und you are mitout
science to know not music itself haf more severe
und mathematic system. Dat boy is at de
end of his shtring of causes&mdash;at de end of his
shtring. Ha!"</p>

<p>"End of his rope is the idiom," said Maver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>ing,
in solemn bass. "It means he's down on
his uppers. You'd better attend to me and
learn pure English. Your English is composite,
mistaken, and slangy, and you are, in
body and mind, an epitome of gross fatness,
whom no science of human variety could
classify."</p>

<p>The depth and solemnity of his voice, the
funereal gravity of his long face, seemed burlesquely
classical. His speech was flowing,
and composed of structural sentences. Moselle
waved his pipe joyously.</p>

<p>"<i>Continuez</i>, Shack! Heet her up! Advance!
Boy, I gif you a lil' pipe and a lil'
beer, but not much, um so you be not sick.
My friend Shack is eloquent und foolish.
Und ve tree vill talk now till to-morrow is gray."</p>

<p>The talk ran on. Already Gard seemed to
himself not merely an hour, but days, weeks&mdash;a
period which the clock could not understand
or measure&mdash;away from the brotherhood. The
country of ideas into which he had come was a
loose republic, where no man knew the limits
of his personality or his daring. He might
loosen his belt and shout, if he chose. Here
conversation was erratic and glancing, not
necessarily an exchange of what one really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
thought; and yet, however obliquely from his
meaning one spoke, there seemed to be less
misunderstanding than among the brothers,
with whom the guiding of the tongue to simple
truth was a matter of searching conscience.
And again, at times, both Moselle and Mavering
would say things that seemed to Gard to
meet the fact or question before them with a
sharper recognition, a more instant candor.
He admired and laughed in pure joy of the
brave, new world that had such creatures in it,
with unstraightened ideas that were free to
dance in the sunbeam or dig in the mine, and
forget whether they had or had not any connection
with the soul's salvation. It was a kind
of renaissance for him, a discovery of humanism
and the pagan pleasure of mere living with
vivacity of body and mind. Here on the
threshold of his new life were two to greet him
who were witty, kind, ironical, experienced,
and seemed to be without care or fear. If,
as Moselle had implied, there were something
hard and critical in the back of his head, some
reserve of judgment, something not plastic and
receptive, but resistent and decisive, it did not
trouble him now with criticisms or decisions,
but let him bask and admire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dey want an organist in Hamilton. It is
Saint Mary's, a church Protestant Episcopal,
called High Church, <i>videlicet</i>, protesting mit
apologies, und cultured to beat de band, vich
is an idiom obscure, my friend Shack. Vat
band?"</p>

<p>"Brass band."</p>

<p>"Ach so! Vell, vat did I mean?"</p>

<p>"Your German mind was headed right, but
went astray on a by-path of idiom. Saint
Mary's culture is not in competition with a
brass band in blue uniform, but aims at the
highest orchestral and surpliced effects."</p>

<p>"Vell, a choir committee wrote me, anyhow,
und I loss de letter. <i>Helas!</i> I loss everyt'ing&mdash;my
reputation, my bes' friends! I put 'em
somevere und forget 'em. Vat did I do mit my
letter?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it's in your pocket."</p>

<p>"Gott! So it is! Vell, dey vant an organist,
und Saint Mary's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has a three-banked organ, and Hamilton
is a sleepy place, good for your neophyte to sit
down in and learn the alphabet of humanity.
I know Saint Mary's."</p>

<p>"Ach! Plazes! So you do!" Moselle stopped
short and looked at Mavering under over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>hanging,
yellowish eyebrows. "Am I intruding&mdash;roping
in your domestic circle, Shack?"</p>

<p>"I think likely. It's no circle. It's an incommensurable
ratio. You know that."</p>

<p>"I know no more than you like, Shack," said
Moselle, gently. "You haf no objections?"</p>

<p>"None at all."</p>

<p>"Vell," said Moselle, after a pause, "so it
is."</p>

<p>"Mr. Windham," said Mavering, flowingly,
"nature cast me for the part of the villain.
She gave me the countenance of one reflecting
darkness, a voice unfit for lighter remarks
than 'I will be revenged!'&mdash;made me a lean
and hungry Cassius, and bid me assassinate
and betray. The inspired text has it that
'All the world's a stage.' It follows that every
man is cast for a r√¥le, and if he tries to introduce
anything not in character he appears
to make a mess of it, the management docks
his salary, and the public blights his career.
I once tried to play a hero and a lover, and
invited the conjunction of happy stars. It
was no good. The notion of it, as you see,
is causing this German monster to make a
braying ass of himself."</p>

<p>"Ho! Ho!" Moselle chuckled, and puffed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
"Der <i>kleiner</i> don' know your stage und your
Shakespeare. He shtare like a house afire."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it."</p>

<p>"Vat is dat, Shack, a house afire? An
idiom extravagant, confusing."</p>

<p>"It means he stares with breathless expectancy,
with bewilderment and fear. I don't
recommend the figure to your use. The conception
of red conflagration and fire-bells is a
Shakespearean flight, and you can't handle
combination figures. You stick to a simple
retail line of business for cash or you'll bust.
You can't take risks and thirty days' credit
for a meaning. The English language has
no confidence in you. You aren't sound for
the market. Mr. Windham, you will probably
meet in Hamilton a Mrs. Mavering, who lives
close by Saint Mary's, and who will say nothing
whatever of me. If I were you I would
cultivate her acquaintance, but imitate that
particular reserve."</p>

<p>"Vell," said Moselle, gently, "das iss good,
but don't fill de <i>kleiner</i> mit bevilderment. He
don' understand, und he take indigestion. Go
buy de grocery und de beer, Shack, und ve
make a dinner here, und to-morrow de <i>kleiner</i>
shall haf human clothes, und go to the theatre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
und see friend Shack arrested for his vickedness
in de fif' act."</p>

<p>After a while the dusk began falling. When
Mavering came back with bundles and a basket
containing a hot shoulder of meat from the
baker's, the long room was lit glimmeringly by
a lamp or two. And Moselle declared finally,
and referred especially to the beer and seasoned
cheese, that he was in favor of the animal
half of man.</p>

<p>"He develope his soul too fast. Let him
vait, let him vait. For his</p>

<p>shtomach und
feet haf stood by him, his friends from old, so
old, und maybe his soul don' do so. She act
frisky, <i>hein</i>?"</p>

<p>Mavering said, "I'm something of a conservative
myself. Man ate before he prayed
and loved the way he ate, but we live in a radical
age."</p>

<p>Then Moselle played dream music, with
fluffy, floating things in it, on one of the pianos,
as though he never ate anything heavier than
lettuce, and was, in the verity of music, a fair
maiden who walked in a green-and-white
garden and was pure and slim as the lilies;
a woodthrush in the distance sang a love song
that was like a hymn, but never came into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
garden, and finally each lily became the spirit
of a lily, the woodthrush the memory of a
song, and garden, maiden and all went up a
silver moonbeam to the moon.</p>

<p>Moselle played on through the evening, and
towards twelve Mavering rose and left. Half
an hour later Moselle swung around on his
piano-stool.</p>

<p>"Shack gone? <i>Kleiner, kleiner!</i> your eyes
are full mit damp shleep;" and he looked at
Gard with his own eyes, grave and old and
calm. "I denke you are more lofable als lofing,
<i>kleiner</i>, an' for an artist de first's nodding,
de last is all. '<i>Geliebt und gelebet</i>.'
Aber one must <i>lieben</i> in order to <i>leben</i>. '<i>Geliebt
und gelebet</i>.' Ach! I haf so."</p>

<p>Gard slept in a room at the end of the hall,
woke in the dawn, and lay waiting for the bell
before matins. Then he remembered, and
laughed aloud. But a throng of memories
rose reproachfully. The chapel organ would
be played badly now; Francis would drone
all day in the schoolroom, but there would
be no one for him to talk with about Cicero's
beautiful adjectives; Brother Andrew would
pat himself on the back of the hand, look
wistfully down the corridor, trot away to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the refectory, and find the salad uninteresting.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So Gard became organist at Saint Mary's
in Hamilton, in the fall of '55, and in time a
noted young person. In the immediate years
that followed, the old life came to seem hardly
more than a vivid dream, or a story told him
by another man who had never left the brothers,
but was still playing for offices and hurrying
along white corridors. He had time on his
hands, and read eagerly, and his rooms grew
littered like Fritz Moselle's. He hardly knew
what he was himself, except a kind of highway,
along which the thoughts of other men, and
emotions that he might claim his own since
they came from nowhere in particular, travelled
hastily. It was something additional to that
sense common to humanity of existence as a
hurried journey from the unknown to the unknown,
his ignorance of his antecedents back
of the Foundlings' Hospital. Yet he seemed
to feel no curiosity about them. They had no
claim upon him, those antecedents, and he
had none to them that he cared to put forward.
The past might bury its wrecks if it could.
His name might be a clue, or it might be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
effort of an inventive or reminiscent nurse.
He never inquired and never knew, then or
thereafter, but was content to have and possess
it, as something that had floated ashore with
him and served well the purposes of a name.
After all, the mortal millions have their severance
from each other ruled with not so great a
difference in point of isolation, and with the
same "salt, estranging sea." Each is for himself
the centre of things; the currents of the
deep swing round him; he is alone with his
main issues.</p>

<p>Gard saw a place and repute slowly forming
for him, and had almost come to see himself
a citizen of Hamilton, the straight road of a
quiet life stretching before him under a cool
gray sky. Moselle, whom he went down into
the greater city to see now and then, doubted
that outcome.</p>

<p>One night in January he came down Charles
Street towards the church. He had fallen into
the habit of playing an hour or two in the latter
part of the evening, and people in the neighborhood
had accepted the custom. Some formed
habits of their own to meet it, and went to
their windows regularly about nine to hark
whether he played that night. It was not an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
agreement, but the silent adaptation in close
communities of habit to habit.</p>

<p>The snow was falling, blown by a keen wind,
and the great side window of Mrs. Mavering's
house glowed warmly through the sharp, slanting
lines of the snow. It occurred to him that
he would rather talk to Mrs. Mavering that
night than summon only spectral visitations
from Saint Mary's organ. At that moment
Helen clung with warm fingers to Mrs. Mavering's
hand, saying, "I shall call you Lady
Rachel, because you're beautiful."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_VIII" id="Chapter_VIII">Chapter VIII</a>
<br /><br />
<small>Of Mrs. Mavering, and of the Philosophy of the Individual</small></h2>

<p>Helen put her forehead against the cold
window.</p>

<p>"It's snowing. Do you think he'll play
to-night? But he would if he knew we wanted
to hear him, wouldn't he?"</p>

<p>"If he knew that we knew he knew it, he
probably would."</p>

<p>The fire glowed and snapped, and reflected
its varying mood on the andirons and the red-and-white
tiles of the fireplace. Mrs. Mavering,
garmented in black and dusky red, lay
back in a deep chair, and the firelight played
across her face and dress in a more subdued
manner than on the tiles and andirons, as if it
felt that was not the right place to be familiar
and reckless.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Men take great pains to be nice to us if
they see their sacrifice is in the way to be ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>preciated.
They would rather have the sacrifice
appreciated than the service. Oh, it isn't
like that, dear eyes!&mdash;not nearly so solemn!"
Helen had come and curled herself at Mrs.
Mavering's feet to consider this proposition.
"If you always look at me so you'll frighten
me out of all my little cynicisms, and I think
them pretty."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mavering reminded one of something
costly, like a vase upon which some master-workman
had spent himself, careless of time,
considering only line and curve, and how it
might be made to glow from within and be
more than worthy of the palace of the king;
and as if afterwards, when the palace had been
sacked, and fallen with ruin and wailing, and
the vase had somehow escaped destruction,
it had come to stand in the guarded corner
of a museum. In this meaning Thaddeus
had spoken of her as something to be seen
rather than some one to know. Thaddeus's
social instinct was quick, and sometimes accurate.
He need not have been so mistaken,
understood as implying the general facts of
a period in Mrs. Mavering's life.</p>

<p>Helen demanded personality even of things.
She inveterately accused persons of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
persons, and brought them to her judgment
bar to account for themselves. Thaddeus
thought Mrs. Mavering should be looked at
for art's sake, for the improvement of the tone
of society; that an official sign, so to speak,
was somewhere at hand, warning that no one
was permitted to touch her humanly.</p>

<p>Helen had not seen the sign. They had
met first in the dark and had been introduced
by a sigh, and she had never been aware of
the barrier with which Mrs. Mavering was
observed to be surrounded. Only Mrs. Mavering
was given to riddling. She acknowledged
herself a person to Helen, stormed by her
headlong admiration, but she never accounted
for herself at the bar, or, as Helen stated it.
"Whenever you say something, and I ask
what you mean, you always act as if you
didn't like what you meant, but you never say
what it was." So far as our sayings come out
of ourselves and ourselves out of our experience,
if part of the experience were such that we
wished to fly from that part of ourselves and
could only flutter the more about it, supposing
this to be Mrs. Mavering's case, her impulse
to dodge Helen's bar of equity might be understood&mdash;and
the fact, too, that she found herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
ever provoking an arraignment. Helen had
to dismiss case after case for lack of evidence,
and because the defendant wanted to play
something else. So that she only wondered
now what Mrs. Mavering meant by "Men
would rather have the sacrifice appreciated
than the service," and whether one would
naturally become difficult by being ten years
older.</p>

<p>"I shall call you Lady Rachel, because you're
beautiful," she said, and the organist of Saint
Mary's stood outside the while and thought
he would rather talk to Mrs. Mavering than
call spectres from the peaks of his gilded organ-pipes
that blown, desolate night.</p>

<p>Of course, one could not become beautiful
like Mrs. Mavering&mdash;not in a hundred years.
One's nose would not become straight, one's
hair black and heapy, nor eyes change from
gray to amber and brown; and in order to
become as difficult it would be necessary to
be married and have one's husband become
unapparent without becoming dead. Mrs. Mavering
was an arduous ideal. Helen doubted
that she would ever achieve it.</p>

<p>"Then I must call you Sir Helen, because
you're such a valiant knight, and always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
charging something, and driving a spear into
the middle of an idea, as if it were a dragon.
But my ideas are not honest, so they have no
middles, and it only makes them look mussy."</p>

<p>"Then," said Helen, quickly, "if I'm a knight
I choose to be in love with you. You're locked
in a tower and I'm after an ogre, only I don't
make out very well what he's doing. Of course,
he growls and rages."</p>

<p>"I dare say he does."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Saint Denis Montjoie! It is a
beautiful fight."</p>

<p>Gard was announced and presently came in.
Mrs. Mavering said:</p>

<p>"Can you play a game? You haven't met
Miss Bourn? She is pursuing an ogre around
a tower. I am locked in the tower. She
doesn't care whether I like being rescued or
not. She isn't sure yet about the ogre, but
thinks she needs one."</p>

<p>"I am a humble person; so is an ogre, isn't
he?" said Gard. "Maybe I'd do. An ogre
ought not to be proud."</p>

<p>"But he always is," said Helen, eagerly.
"He keeps a tower to be proud in."</p>

<p>"Where is my tower, then?"</p>

<p>Helen hesitated. She had never seen him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
near before. He looked a little singular, not
quite like other people, a little weary and very
white-faced, a little impenetrable. She remembered
all he had said to her through Saint
Mary's organ, things sensitive and intimate.</p>

<p>The process of putting together two groups
of impressions to make one personality is
difficult, and one ought to have time. But he
insisted on knowing where the tower was.
"I don't know how to be an ogre without it,"
so that she said, hastily, "You must have one
in the organ-loft," and was not at all sure
that it meant anything, if it were not an entire
mistake, and was glad when they sat down
without calling for more explanations. She
slid down to her old place by Mrs. Mavering
and half listened to them, and half studied a
problem, to see what was honestly true about
it, or whether it had any middle.</p>

<p>When Helen was little, she used to compose
parables and sermons, and sometimes wept to
think how beautiful they were, and declaimed
them to her mother, who had only one comment
to make. It was, "Why, Helen!" Such
was the parable of the Perfect Cat, who lived a
life of absolute sinlessness. There was a sermon
on David and Absalom&mdash;"Oh, Absalom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
my son!" It was tearful at that point. But
the moral was that Absalom was hung by his
hair&mdash;a sorrowful incident. People should not
make their children have long hair. "And I
have asked you three times to-day, 'Mother,
please, may I cut it off?' and you just said,
'Why, Helen!' and I'm not going to ask
again. I'm going to put you in the closing
prayer." So that now she put her conclusion
into a sermon, to the effect that every one had a
tower in which part of himself or herself was a
proud ogre, and another part was a valiant
knight who ought to eventually thrust a lance
into the middle of the ogre to make him humble
and social, or else dead, so that both together
might become a perfect character before
the benediction. Because a proper sermon was
like a story, inasmuch as in the first part you
made things look as badly as possible and
talked about wickedness, so that everybody
might become interested; and in the last part
you talked about goodness and made goodness
succeed after difficulty, so that everybody
might become calm; and in the benediction
you told everybody to be happy ever after.</p>

<p>"Do you read Emerson," Gard was saying to
Mrs. Mavering&mdash;"the Massachusetts lecturer?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
He says, 'The Eden of God is bare and grand';
but I don't see anything more than a personal
fancy in that. Anyway, the poets would be
wrong in putting music in such an Eden.
An organ is full of sin and sorrow. The pipes
always seem to me to hold so many human
emotions compressed and stowed away, like
the genius in Solomon's bottle. Say one of
them is a pure aspiration and one of them a
snarling desire. You set the snarling desire
chasing the pure aspiration, and you have one
of the simple formul√¶ for expressing humanity.
It isn't Eden."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's like my knight and ogre!" cried
Helen. "Do you do sermons and parables?
But you have the wrong one running away."</p>

<p>Gard looked surprised, and then laughed.
"It was all going on round and round a tower,
wasn't it? And if the tower were small you
couldn't tell which was running away."</p>

<p>"But <i>they</i> would know!" said Helen, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"But they might differ, or they might forget,
on account of going so fast. Then they'd
have to stop and ask the lady in the tower to
straighten them out."</p>

<p>Helen looked puzzled, felt that the parable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
was too mixed to mean anything now, and
suspected Gard of mixing it frivolously.</p>

<p>"The lady in the tower is too dizzy, you both
run about so fast," said Mrs. Mavering. "But
she thinks Helen would never run away."</p>

<p>"There's no chance for me to be proud in
this tower," said Gard, and Helen murmured:</p>

<p>"It's all mixed up."</p>

<p>"Music, after all," said Gard, breaking a
few moments' silence, "leaves you unsatisfied
at your strongest. It is misty emotion. It has
wings, but no feet. You seem to want something
that has more grip and bite."</p>

<p>"That is heresy from you," said Mrs. Mavering.</p>

<p>"I've made a creed of heresy, you know.
That Massachusetts lecturer preaches the
creed, 'Every man his own issue, for conformity
is death.' But I don't know whether he has
said that conformity to the forms you have
made yourself is as much death as conformity
to those made by other men. I call myself a
musician, and something keeps asking me,
'Is that all?' It seems to think it time I called
myself something else."</p>

<p>"Then why not call yourself a still better
musician?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course, one needn't stand still altogether.
You become more skilful with your fingers
and feet, and learn better how to render and
interpret the emotions, musical ideas, more
or less eccentric crotchets, of other men, the
best of them dead. Their emotions are not
so important, are they? Haven't we eyes of
our own to see that grass is green? Oh yes,
we compose. Have you seen my new book?
It consists of a prelude, that is very bad, and
highly praised by competent critics in journals;
an offertory, in which Charity appears as
despondent of the results of the collection&mdash;I'm
conceited about that piece&mdash;and a symphony
in five movements, which is a padded
invalid. Room enough for improvement, you
see. I might learn to symbolize a mood more
accurately. It wouldn't make the mood any
less futile. The point is really that it doesn't
get you out of a rut, if you make the rut even
a very good rut of its kind. The more you
dig at it the deeper it grows. There is too
much that you never see and never know. You
take the shape of your mould. Do you know
Dr. Holmes' 'Chambered Nautilus'? The
nautilus made a larger shell for himself every
time he changed, but the poet didn't comment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
on his making each shell of the same shape
as the last. He was a stale conformer after
all, that nautilus."</p>

<p>"Do you think he would have done better
if he had tried to make a shell for himself like
an oyster's or a crab's?"</p>

<p>"He wouldn't have done better in the matter
of shells. But personally he would have gone
up the scale of intelligence."</p>

<p>"He would have been very uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"Oh, it wasn't claimed that conformity was
not comfortable. It was only said to be death."</p>

<p>"Didn't the nautilus have a very beautiful
shell?" Mrs. Mavering spoke in a low voice.
"If you ask me, I don't think human life is
better than music. I think music is the better
of the two." Gard seemed mutely to understand
her, and was silent a moment as if to
let the shadow pass, then said:</p>

<p>"Music is a little like the nautilus-shell,
isn't it?&mdash;the venturous bark that flings its
purple wings in gulfs enchanted, and all that.
But isn't 'all that' rather a foolish thing to do
forever? Purple wings in enchanted gulfs&mdash;it's
a narrow experience when you come to
think of it."</p>

<p>Gard rose to go, but stood a moment looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
at the two, as if he wanted to fix the picture of
them and carry it away; of the woman with
heavy hair, in a black-and-red dress, who
gave the impression of wearing jewelry and
really wore none, and the girl in white with a
blue band at her throat, slim hands that somehow
looked so strong, and gray eyes that demanded
candor and offered imaginations. The
firelight played over them as if it were trying
to illustrate the subject, saying, "This is
worth while to understand."</p>

<p>"Do you know there's a war coming?"
said Gard. "Trumpets and drums are in the
air."</p>

<p>After that he went away, and through the
blowing storm along Philip's road to his
rooms, which looked out on the law school
square. The front room was full of the traces
and tokens of the six years past, indicating
what the mental life then had been, but not
very clearly what result had come out of it all.
There were books in number and confusion,
as if he did not care for them in a bookish way,
but only as mines, clefts, or fissures where
metals are sometimes to be found&mdash;and if found
and dug out, the source has no more personal
value. There were some lounging-chairs, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
desk with a litter of sheet-music and scored
manuscript.</p>

<p>Gard's face was whiter and thinner than
of old. It was noticeably white, with heavy
eyelids, and the peculiar curve of hair-line
that Moselle once noticed. One might fancy a
trace of the cloister in it, not in anything that
could be called clerical, but in something that
could be called isolated. If there is manifestation
in all faces of the spirit within, it would
have seemed to manifest a certain separateness;
as if, having learned in the cloister, at the age
when one takes fundamental impressions, that a
man is nothing else noticeable than a soul alone,
with the eternities watching and the one issue
of its salvation before it, he had never been rid
of that sense of things, but had only altered
his conception of the issue, and so the terms of
description and the method of pursuit. This
sense of things, of life as a kind of personal
adventure, a kind of fortune-hunting after an
ideal of self-culture, an ambition for a mental
career rather than one apparent outwardly to
men, may have sprung from far back in his
nature and been of precloistral origin, come
slowly of late years to a theory. The peculiarity
of his coming, as one dropped out of a darker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
cloud than most men come from into the light
of consciousness, may have added to this dim
sense of isolation, of adventure, of destiny experimenting
more definitely with him, of eternities
more watchful. Not that he compared himself in
that way with other men. The comparison, if it
had occurred to him, would not have seemed interesting,
or bearing on the issue. To each belonged
his independent adventure; each was at the same
time an end to himself and a means to other people.</p>

<p>Such progress and pilgrimage had its own
perils, excitements, and new landscapes opening
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>The picture that remained in Gard's mind of
Mrs. Mavering and Helen seemed to him significant
of something&mdash;Helen looking up with question
and appeal to the older woman, the coloring,
the firelight. She had brave eyes, that girl. One
ought to see more of women. Mrs. Mavering
looked like a kind of imperial exile. He sat down
at the piano and touched a key thoughtfully.
They signified something, surely, if one could put
it into form. He wondered what had become of
Mavering. Fritz Moselle was growing apoplectic,
and people were talking about war. If
old orders were changing, it was probably time
they changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_IX" id="Chapter_IX">Chapter IX</a>
<br /><br />
<small>Of Estates in Happiness</small></h2>

<p>"In point of fact," said Thaddeus, "I am proposing
a partnership, to be entitled 'The Helen
Banking and Brokerage Company,' organized
to do business for a commission."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I understand," said Mrs.
Mavering, slowly.</p>

<p>"We make investments at interest, speculate
in futures, examine securities." He paused,
seeking precision of phrase. "It is in terms of
happiness. One pursues it&mdash;happiness. One
sees fortunes in it lost and fortunes won. I
find I have spent my own capital. I have to
be content with a commission."</p>

<p>But then it was not evident that Mrs. Mavering
need be in the same case. It would be
poor taste to seem to assume it. "In point of
fact," she suggested a hoarded wealth, an
unknown, mysterious sum in reserve, rather
than even poverty in respect to a future. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
she might be allowed to express for herself the
terms of her profit.</p>

<p>"I think I understand now," she said.</p>

<p>Her veil had little beads of moisture on it from
the damp March wind that blew down Shannon
Street in their faces. The gutters were slushy
running streams, the elms shook their branches
restlessly, as if full of the sweet pains of
stirring sap and the coming birth of leaves.</p>

<p>"Acting," continued Thaddeus, "in behalf
of the Helen estate, which I believe, I trust,
will prove large, but is, I think, I fear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You think uncertain?"</p>

<p>"Doubtless uncertain. There are elements
of uncertainty. And in this matter I must
confess myself only a man, a sad limitation.
Mrs. Mavering; somewhat elderly, too; and so,
one who feels he must husband his slender
resources. I fear I depend very much on that
commission. I fear the bankruptcy of that
estate would be disastrous for me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mavering drew her veil closer, and they
walked on a few moments in silence. Then
she ventured:</p>

<p>"Uncertain, of course; but you spoke of
elements."</p>

<p>"I might mention, in regard to the nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
of it at present, a certain impetuosity, a determination,
a loyalty perhaps a little too inflexible.
Flexibility is, so to speak, to have a
good portion of one's capital near by for emergencies.
I might mention, to speak technically,
as a liability, a certain Morgan Map."</p>

<p>"But that," said she, hurriedly&mdash;"I mean.
I know him only slightly, but Helen said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You would wish me to convince you that
he is liability rather than an asset."</p>

<p>"Why not convince her?"</p>

<p>"Ah, but there! Might it not&mdash;I have
tested, I fear it would, I ask your better intuition&mdash;might
not the attempt, if made seriously,
defeat its end by rousing that loyalty, giving
perhaps direction and opportunity to that&mdash;that
inflexibility?"</p>

<p>"It might."</p>

<p>Thaddeus lifted a neatly gloved hand, and
cane swinging between the fingers.</p>

<p>"To be flexible, to adapt oneself. There
are so many doors, it is well not to be too absolutely
one kind of key. I have heard a
phrase, which appears to be a recent discovery&mdash;this
phrase, 'The survival of the fittest.' It
was explained to me, who am not profound, I
confess. Dear me, no; nor a reader of new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
books. But I understood it to mean the survival
of that which fits, the introduction of
order by the elimination of the disorderly, of
the&mdash;a&mdash;antagonistic, and so the final result
of a race and a world to fit each other like hand
and glove. A happy consummation."</p>

<p>"But Helen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly. Helen's ancestors&mdash;my own, too;
how singular! They cultivated a characteristic&mdash;a
tendency to martyrdom. I believe a
certain Bourn was put to death in the sixteenth
century for obdurate persistence in a proscribed
opinion. Probably later, in New England,
some of them were by their neighbors said
to be 'sot.' My brother was an obdurately
unhappy person."</p>

<p>"But this Morgan Map?"</p>

<p>"An aboriginal, an anachronism. He belongs
in the primeval wilderness with other&mdash;pardon
me&mdash;brutes. His father had a singular
opinion of him&mdash;a&mdash;that reminds me; he had a
very singular opinion, very singular."</p>

<p>Thaddeus mused a moment.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mavering, will you dine with us on
Wednesday?"</p>

<p>They came to the corner of Charles Street,
and parted at Mrs. Mavering's door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>To obtain a small measure of happiness as a
commission for managing another person's
estate in the same kind of property! She
wondered if Thaddeus were not really a wise
man, who made a pretext of frivolity. He seemed
to have definite theories of things. It might
be his rapid and light manner was part of his
wisdom and his theory, as if he had found it
the part of wisdom not to look gravely and
long at any phase of human life. Who knows
what might be disclosed, for all depths are
black and threatening. One should touch
surfaces and slip away before the depths boil
up. If Thaddeus had really attained skill and
success, it was something to admire. For
herself, she seemed to have failed. She had
stirred the depths and had not found them on
the whole pleasant.</p>

<p>Thaddeus's house was four-square, of a yellowish
stucco, with a raised entrance and a windowed
cupola. They built so, and so decorated
within, when they endeavored to build decoratively,
a half century or more ago; they impressed
a generation following with a hunted,
persistent sense that in some manner a marble
mantel, a plaster ornament on the ceiling, an
ormolu clock, a flowered carpet, and china<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
figurines with neat stockings, were the types
and accepted symbols of earthly splendor.
Plush upholstery was a proper thing in Thaddeus's
day, and Thaddeus had it. He desired
the presence of that which was fit, accepted,
not provocative of dispute.</p>

<p>And so his little dinner of five passed fitly.
He manipulated Gard to the piano, Helen near
by, Morgan in position to observe her, and
Mrs. Mavering in position to observe all. He
drew his chair near Mrs. Mavering and smiled
a wrinkled smile of content. He felt creative
with respect to the situation, a strategist who
had securely arranged how the enemy should
act.</p>

<p>"He will growl," he said to Mrs. Mavering,
softly; "the bristles will rise on his spine.
My dear Mrs. Mavering, a primary egotist is
an impossible person out of the jungle."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mavering thought she could see why
Morgan suggested to Thaddeus such terms as
"primitive," "aboriginal." There was something
rugged and rough-hewn evident in the
first place, a massiveness of antediluvian bone,
such as they dig from the clay banks of
rivers. "We are all egotists," was Thaddeus's
theory, "but the primary won't do." He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
savage and solitary, too direct, too elemental.
He jumps to his aim. He does not care, so
he gets it, what happens in between. He does
not care for minor points. But civilization is a
system of minor points. He has no sympathy,
cannot move from his footing an inch to take
another point of view. Doubtless he will lie
and betray, for they are minor points of method,
and faith and truth are social products. At
least, he will not notice what he may happen
incidentally to step on, or what becomes of an
opposition after it is sufficiently smashed.
"Why," he asked, primitively, "why should I?"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Mavering thought all this seemed
an airy structure, built on a theory which
was very likely a prejudice.</p>

<p>Gard was playing something martial, with
the shrilling of fifes, the mutter of drums in it,
and the measured tramp of feet. He was
looking at Helen to see if she knew what he
meant, because one liked to look at her, no
doubt; it seemed to justify itself; but more
particularly because he had fancied of late that
her face was a kind of magic mirror, such as
enchanters used to raise upon by incantation
their pictured prophecies, and that he was become
able to summon to it the shadows and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
counterparts of his moods, and watch the
brightening and darkening of himself in reflection.</p>

<p>When he would come from the organ-loft,
find her with Mrs. Mavering in the dark under
the gallery by the stone pillar, and the three
go out across the yard to Mrs. Mavering's
house, he always found that Helen's interpretations,
however wide they might be from
his own in point of verbal symbols and form of
allegory, followed the mood with accurate detail.
Only the mirror tended to add moral judgments,
or to substitute the terms, right and wrong,
for beautiful and ugly, for harmony and discord,
and in that respect appeared to be inaccurate.
Still, it enabled him to realize himself
with curious vividness.</p>

<p>Helen's face was flushed. Presently Gard
became absorbed and looked at it no longer.
He was trying to get not merely the sound of
the marching, the ripple of the flags, and the
elation of the crowds, but something about
devotion and the spirit of the nation shining
like the sun on the faces of its soldiers. Mrs.
Mavering, too, turned from Helen, and noticed
how thickly Morgan's yellow eyebrows were
knit above his eyes, which seemed to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
kind of green glare in them. They were fixed
on Helen. A sudden memory shot through
Mrs. Mavering's mind like a sharp pain&mdash;she
shivered. Thaddeus noted it.</p>

<p>"Exactly," he murmured to her; "quite so."</p>

<p>Gard found his theme and began weaving
it in among the drums and fifes, increasing it
until drums, fifes, and flags seemed only like
the surface ripple of a deep stream, so grave
it was, so large and resolute, so brimmed with
its purpose. Helen saw the success and bent
forward. Morgan made a slight choking noise
in his throat.</p>

<p>"Exactly," murmured Thaddeus; "quite so."</p>

<p>Gard finished abruptly and turned to Helen.
"I don't suppose it's half true." He appeared
to be continuing the subject, secure of her understanding
it up to that point.</p>

<p>"Oh, why not?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't read like it in the newspapers,"
he said, and rose presently to go. Thaddeus,
too, must run down to his club; would Mrs.
Mavering forgive him and stay with Helen
till he came back? Morgan took his leave
with conventional phrases. And the three
having each taken himself and his egoism
away, Helen and Mrs. Mavering were left with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Thaddeus's trim sea-coal fire, marble mantle,
china figurines of the neat ankles, gilt chandeliers,
and flowered carpet.</p>

<p>Helen took her favorite place at Mrs. Mavering's
feet, and said, "Uncle Tad's fires always
have company manners."</p>

<p>As for Morgan, Mrs. Mavering thought, he
did not like to see that Helen could be moved
by powers that he could not himself attain;
perhaps neither knew nor cared what those
powers were, only knew that he could not attain
them. But Thaddeus's airy structure, his
theory of the primitive, did not follow necessarily.
Yet she felt that a certain atmosphere
of animosity surrounded Morgan; he was either
aggressively or indifferently hostile; or else it
was because one felt his intention to dominate,
and indifference whether the dominance were
admitted with peace or in process of war.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to confess, Helen?"</p>

<p>"I'm always confessing, Lady Rachel."</p>

<p>"But about Morgan Map?"</p>

<p>"Oh, why, Morgan is&mdash;just Morgan, don't
you see?"</p>

<p>"That sounds like a whole dictionary, but
the words don't seem to be arranged."</p>

<p>"It's arranged by the alphabet," Helen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
laughed. "It begins with A, when I was
born."</p>

<p>"I was wondering if it went through to Z."</p>

<p>"Oh! But, Lady Rachel, I don't think I
know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Has he asked you to marry him?"</p>

<p>"Not that, of course not. But he said he
was going to marry me."</p>

<p>"When? How long ago?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't remember."</p>

<p>"But what did you think about it?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Lady Rachel, I suppose I
thought it was too good of him to believe, and
I suppose I wondered if he wouldn't forget
about it by-and-by. And do you know, he
didn't&mdash;that is, I don't think so."</p>

<p>"But, you funny child, you don't tell me at
all. Did you promise to marry him?"</p>

<p>"Promise! He never asked me to do that."</p>

<p>"Do you love him, dear?"</p>

<p>"Never asked me to do that, either."</p>

<p>"But, Helen, you dodge like a wild thing.
If you don't love him and he expects you to
marry him, you must tell him you won't."</p>

<p>"Why?" Helen rumpled her hair with swift
hand. "There'd be a frightful fight. You
see, Lady Rachel"&mdash;plaintively&mdash;"whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
I fight with Morgan I get so&mdash;so smashed.
Don't you know, it makes your bones sore,
and gives you a headache. Besides, Morgan
always does what he means to do, and he
knows all sorts of things, and if he means to
marry me I suppose he will, and I suppose he
knows&mdash;well, whether I love him or not. 'My
word!' says Uncle Tad, 'I don't.'"</p>

<p>"Don't what?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, Lady Rachel. Suppose I
said 'Morgan Map, I don't love you, there!'
then he'd say, 'You do, too,' or else, 'That's
my lookout,' or something, and what would I
do then? Oh, yes, I'd say, 'Well, then, I won't
marry you,' and he'd say, 'Much you know
about it,' or if he was cross there'd be a fight,
and I never get anything out of that. Isn't it
funny, Uncle Tad doesn't like Morgan at all."</p>

<p>"I don't think," said Mrs. Mavering, slowly,
"that I do, either, but it looks as if I ought not
to say so. Do you mind?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. Morgan doesn't care who
dislikes him, except me; and if I did, don't
you see, it would be only one of the words in
the dictionary."</p>

<p>"I think I begin to see. But I'm still wondering
if there isn't one word left out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why&mdash;But I don't know what you mean.
What makes you so solemn, Lady Rachel?
You bother and bother about Morgan, and
he's not so worth while, not so&mdash;around in
the dark as Gard Windham, who says things
out of the middle of himself without talking
at all, and you understand him, you don't
know how, and it makes your hair tingle.
Lady Rachel, listen! Let's go to the war."</p>

<p>"The war!"</p>

<p>"Didn't you know there is to be one? And
Morgan's going to be a captain, or colonel, or
something. He wouldn't let me, but we'd
wait till he was gone, and then I'd only have
to fight with Uncle Tad, and I wouldn't mind
that."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mavering fell to wondering if there
had ever been a time when she was like this
herself, as bright and fearless; as little conscious
or afraid of looming shadows. She
thought she had not been quite like this. There
must have been less will and more desire of
ease. She thought she had loved a better
man than Morgan Map, at least one more
varied and peculiar, if not so poised and secure
of himself; a strange man, restless and reckless.
The two did not look alike; Jack was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
dark, long-jawed, and lean; but when she had
noted Morgan knitting his yellow brows, and
imagined there was an odd glint in his eyes,
she had thought of one of Jack's moods, and
shivered. Jack was never jealous. But there
was some mark, something common to them
both, that sent a searching chill, that seemed
like a denial of all close comforts and small
loving things. Or was it only her own weakness
and fanciful fears, born of those past
times when she had learned to be afraid of the
next day?</p>

<p>Thaddeus was an airy theorist. Besides,
he seemed to be mainly interested in his commission,
which perhaps would not accrue if
Helen went off with her capital of happiness
independently. Searching through her experience,
she was not sure how much that she
found bore on the subject. It had not seemed
a question of courage when she had first
girded up her garments and followed where
she was led. It had seemed inevitable. Jack's
name was the whole dictionary, and there
appeared to be no word entirely outside of it.
And then the awakening; a series of chasms
opening, the bright world breaking up, and
sections of it tumbling down the black chasms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
She seemed to see his face, with its large, mobile
mouth, painted against Thaddeus's fireplace,
as he had looked when he had left her that
last day in the early morning; heard his laugh,
and the echo in the empty hall of the door that
had closed behind him.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I have had almost enough of
adventures. When I came back to live here
I was very tired."</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell me?" said Helen, in
an awed tone.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not everything. But you know
I was born here, and my name was Ulic, and
all that, till I was married. Mr. Mavering
came to Hamilton when I was about your age,
and I think he was looking for anything that
would interest him, but not expecting it would
interest him very long. He had a great deal
of money then, but he has done all sorts of
things with it, and I don't know that he has
any now. I suppose he was engaged in what
your uncle calls 'the pursuit of happiness,'
and he seemed to be successful. He got so
much amusement wherever he went, and his way
of doing it was&mdash;some of it&mdash;expensive. But
perhaps it cost me more than any one else, unless&mdash;but
I don't know about that. He was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
clever, and I thought him wonderful. I think
he must have been a little extraordinary. I
thought no one else had a lover who paid such
compliments. He used to say, 'Life is a joke
between God and the devil. You are a bright
remark by the former, Rachel, and I am the
latter's repartee.' He never tried to conceal
anything about himself. Then we went adventuring.
You see, my story turns on Jack's
being so queer&mdash;at least, his coming to seems so
to me. I couldn't like things and people that
were evil and coarse, or like being always
dragged into the danger of some kind of disgrace.
You can't, if you have been taught to
be scrupulous. But he did not seem to see
differences between good and bad, and refined
and coarse, or else he thought them petty differences.
He liked almost anything except
being dull. We went from place to place,
and across the sea and back again. He was
restless&mdash;and reckless. I think he was too
reckless of me. Once we had a house at New
Orleans, where the planters used to come and
play cards, and there were queer women with
very dark eyes, and some of the planters were
quite old men. But one night one of the women
killed a planter with a knife, on the stairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Then we got out of a window on a back roof,
and through alleys to the levee, and went up
the river in the morning on a steamer. I
don't know what it was all about&mdash;quite. But
there were things that happened which I minded
more than that. I used to be so tired, so afraid.
Then I grew to be afraid of Jack, because I
couldn't understand him, because whenever
things were very black and horrible, or seemed
so to me, he acted more amused and queer,
as if it were all a kind of play in the theatre.
And he did not grow worse through all this;
he did not change at all; but I grew worse.
I tried to be like him, but I couldn't. Of course,
we knew a great many people, and sometimes
were fashionable. Once in London we went
to great balls and receptions. But Jack saw
some Hindoo snake-charmers, and wanted to
be one, and travel about in turbans and yellow
cloth. I don't know why we didn't do that,
but we came home soon after. And we quarrelled
very miserably&mdash;that is, I did. Then the
Ulics became excited about it. One night,
or early in the morning, I woke up and heard
some one very angry in the next room. Jack
never became angry. It was another man. I
don't know who it was. There was a struggle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
I suppose Jack struck him, and he fell. I
crept and opened the door. The window was
open and Jack was dropping the man out of it
into the area. Then he laughed to himself,
and turned around and saw me." Mrs. Mavering's
voice faltered, and she paused.</p>

<p>"It wasn't so much of an incident, only it
was the last. After he left I began to shiver
and sob, and I crept to the window and closed
it. I thought he had killed him, but of course
he hadn't. It was winter, and the snow was
deep in the area. He dragged the man up the
steps, held him by the collar against the railing,
and brushed him and laughed. Then he took
him away, holding him up by the arm. It
was characteristic, for he never bore any person
a grudge for any harm he may have done
that person. Most people do. He doesn't bear
me any grudge. I came back to Hamilton
then.</p>

<p>"Forgive me for telling you my poor story.
I thought when I began there might be something
in it to tell you particularly, but I see
there wasn't. And really it isn't much of a
story, only a quantity of details.</p>

<p>"I suppose," she continued, slowly, after
another pause, "that your uncle would class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Jack with the half civilized, or belonging really
to a past time, when everything was unsettled
and everybody was adventurous. He
calls Morgan Map a primary, or aboriginal. I
suppose he would call Jack a secondary, or
nomadic, and perhaps," with a little laugh,
"he calls himself a tertiary. I wonder if
there are any more degrees."</p>

<p>Helen sat very quietly, drooping her head,
and did not smile. Without understanding,
she felt as if a hand in the darkness had
struck her, as if a vista had opened, and all
along it were crouching melancholy shapes
and strange fears with faces hidden.</p>

<p>When Thaddeus came back he stood a moment
in the doorway, and smiled with wrinkled
cheeks.</p>

<p>"You look," he said, "like Israel by the
waters of Babylon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_X" id="Chapter_X">Chapter X</a>
<br /><br />
<small>Of Spring in Hamilton&mdash;Of Thaddeus's Opportunity
to be Candid</small></h2>

<p>In the open country the seasons are free,
and work their will with spacious confidence.
There is room between heaven and earth.
Spring runs down the back of the mountain
forest, and races the river; the heat of summer
has reason, leisure, and is motherly of green
things; autumn has its cornfields, leagues of
yellow landscape, and the progress in cool
order of harvest and death; winter its distances
and long-drawn breath from the pole. Their
functions there are customary, familiar, old.
They can swing at large. They need not hesitate.
But in city streets they go timidly, as if
they fancied something in man and his civil
doings not in the original regulations. They
are conservative. An innovation was made,
not so long ago, in their ancient memories;
a creature containing an unknown chemical
was developed and introduced. They seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
to remember that objections were made at the
time. It was said, "You never can tell what
will come of it." And you never could. They
never became used to or at ease with it. The
innovation was even dissatisfied with nature,
the ground-plan and mother of them all. He
laid out cities to contradict her. He questioned,
too, the wisdom of his creation, noted his own
discordance, and went on to call his discontent
divine.</p>

<p>And spring entered Hamilton. One felt
something moist, warm, and sticky in the air,
and knew what she was about, trying to make
civil kisses out of her fructifying young enthusiasm,
her tidal tenderness, and feeling
embarrassed so that she made something
moist, warm, and sticky. Baby green leaves
were on the maples of Shannon Street and on
the elms of the Common; rain was on the roofs
at dawn, and the gutters flowed all day; busy
citizen birds were notable on lawns, strayed
songsters gurgling with happiness, or voicing
spring longing in plaintive "pee-wees."</p>

<p>And Hamilton cared little about it. The
Third Volunteers and a troop of militia cavalry
were camped in the Fair grounds by the end
of May, and people sat in the grand stands to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
see them drill. There were rows of neat, new
tents, lines of men trying to keep step to a drum,
bugle calls, cavalry charges, and turf cut to
mud or dust. A blue sky was overhead whose
peace was too deep and distant to be known,
but one could infer it from the nearer peace of
the white, drifting clouds. There was Lieutenant
Map, with straps, visored cap, and sword,
which Thaddeus thought should have been a
club or javelin. "He'll not be suitably dressed
till he's tattooed." Thaddeus even pursued and
caught happiness in the situation, the changing
pulse of the times. There were advantages to
society in this panoply and thrill of war, which
filled the eye and ear, entertained the thoughts,
stirred the feelings to an interested activity.
Society became more united, the units more
sympathetic with each other. It was not good
for banking; but for society, really, to sit in a
grand-stand and watch extraordinary affairs
go on in which society had such share and
interest, was for society in the highest degree,
in point of fact, inspiring. How brutal, how
degrading, how primitive the Roman arenas!
But here the higher feelings were enlisted.
One saw battle-grounds imaginatively&mdash;their
blood and dust idealized, made symbolic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Rachel and Helen agreed with him without
difficulty. It seemed to Helen quite splendid
and natural for Morgan to go to the war. And
both thought the cavalry and the bugles made
everything real. It was not so long before that
one heard there was such a place as Sumter,
and even yet the objections made to anybody's
firing at it seemed a little difficult to grasp with
sympathy. Was not a fort made to be fired
at? A little while before they had been told
to dislike abolitionists, and had done so. Now
they were told to dislike secessionists, and did
so; but both were abstract. But here, on the
familiar Fair grounds, were visible men in
earnest, who were to be shot at and possibly
hit by individuals. It was another matter
than abstract secessionists shooting at a fort
that was not interesting in itself. So that
Rachel and Helen waved their handkerchiefs,
and Thaddeus rapped with his cane, while the
dark-blue lines broke and reformed, the bugles
sounded, drums beat, troops of horsemen swept
by, and overhead the sky possessed another
blue and the drifting clouds a different movement.</p>

<p>They came home by Philip's road. The
maples on Philip's road spread leaves that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
passed from babyhood into youth in the sunlight
and soft, damp air. They found Gard
sitting disconsolately on Mrs. Mavering's steps,
in blue uniform. Thaddeus said, "There's
another patriot whose clothes don't fit."</p>

<p>"I was afraid I'd have to leave before you
came," Gard explained. "I've had a rapid
day. Decided at one o'clock to enlist; enlisted
at two; told the rector at three I wouldn't play
his old organ a day longer; drew this outfit at
four. It's five now. But the rector was game.
He said if he was twenty years younger he
wouldn't preach in his old pulpit any more.
May I come in half an hour, Mrs. Mavering?"</p>

<p>Thaddeus settled his glasses. "Young man.
I should have said you were too wise for a
warrior. Are you aware that cold lead, taken
suddenly in any quantity, is injurious to the
system?"</p>

<p>"What system?"</p>

<p>"The physical system of the&mdash;a&mdash;person
taking it."</p>

<p>"Is it?" said Gard. "But it might be a
mental tonic."</p>

<p>They all went in except Thaddeus, who
walked down the street, scenting the air with
delicate nostril.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;that one&mdash;I don't seem to make
him out."</p>

<p>"You see, Mrs. Mavering," said Gard, "there
are only a few people I want to tell about anything
I do&mdash;you and Helen, and Fritz Moselle,
and some of the brothers. Now, Fritz Moselle
will say, 'Vat for a fool of a musician! Aber,
you nefer get so fat as me if you don' be contented.'
Brother Francis will quote the Anabasis,
and Andrew will give it up, and the
Superior act like the Apocalypse. Now, what
do you say?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Every one else is thinking
about one thing now. I should have said you
would think about something different."</p>

<p>Gard kindled with the eagerness peculiar to
him when on the track of an idea, or trying to
state one that was clear to him but seemed to
struggle against statement&mdash;a kind of tension
and nervous thrill, like that of a hunting dog
when the trail is hot.</p>

<p>"But going with the crowd is all right if it's
going the way you want to go. And the more
undistinguished from the mass you appear to
be, the more you can keep a unit to yourself.
I shouldn't like to be an officer, for then I'd
be responsible for other men. But a private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
marches where he's ordered, and shoots according
to prescription. So he can watch the
big phenomenon all around him and feel it
racing through his blood. Can't he? I can
feel it already. Can't you? Of course. But
I want to look it in the face. If a man had
a chance to be a crusader in his time he'd be
foolish to miss it. He'd miss the flavor of his
time. I'd sooner decline the acquaintance of a
Shakespeare."</p>

<p>He looked at Helen eagerly. She stood
among the potted plants in the bay window,
looking out. He had thought she would seem
more interested. She must be interested. Any
one who had seen her eyes light up suddenly
and often would know that. He wondered
what clue to some unexpected significance she
was following now, that she seemed absent-minded
among the potted plants. Every one
had his or her personal solitary adventure.
Helen, of course, had hers. One had to remember
that.</p>

<p>"I play to-night the last time. Will you be
under the gallery?"</p>

<p>Then he went away. And Helen, among the
potted plants, followed a clue to this unexpected
significance, that it did not seem to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
splendid and natural for Gard, too, to go to the
war. It seemed like the hand in the darkness
from Rachel's story, the vista where melancholy
shapes and fears crouched and hid their
faces. She watched him go down Queen Mary
Street towards the Common. Morgan Map,
striding down from Philip's road, saw him
come out, said to himself, referring to the uniform.
"It's that organ player! Who next?"&mdash;looked
up and saw Helen's profile above the
plants in the window, and stopped. A moment
later he turned and walked back.</p>

<p>In Saint Mary's, that night, the music did
not seem to Helen to come down from choir
loft as usual, and talk to her familiarly. She
could not make it say anything. It stayed up
among the organ-pipes; and below, among the
pillars and aisles instead, the wind of a coming
storm blowing in through the vestibule doors,
half open&mdash;for the night was heavy and close&mdash;took
its place, whispered, moaned, and wailed:
"You've no idea how black it's growing.
Shut the doors and hide." At least, she was
only able to make the music say something
about going away, and that "if people never
meet again, never is a long, long time." She
was glad when it was over, and Gard came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
around and under the gallery. They walked
across the yard silently. The night had grown
black, the branches tossed, and the leaves
fluttered audibly in the darkness over them.
They found Morgan walking to and fro in the
edge of the light from Mrs. Mavering's window.</p>

<p>"Why, Morgan!"</p>

<p>And Gard saluted, "Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"I want to see you, Nellie. Are you going
home?" Then to Gard and his uniform.
"Isn't that rather sudden?"</p>

<p>"It's the latest fashion. I report at nine,
they say. Good-night."</p>

<p>And Mrs. Mavering, mounting her steps,
turned to watch Morgan and Helen, and noted
that they, too, walked quite silently still, till
they turned the corner in front of Thaddeus's
house and disappeared.</p>

<p>Thaddeus sat in the little room behind the
drawing-room. At the sound of the rising
wind he went to the window, looked out uneasily,
and listened. The wind was too loud
for him to hear the organ, even if it still were
going. But he heard the hall-door open, and
so went back contentedly to his newspaper,
in which it was stated that a certain officer, in
bringing a Confederate flag from a hotel roof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
in Alexandria, was shot by the hotel-keeper,
who in turn was shot by a person accompanying
the said officer. Really, people acted with
singular earnestness and energy nowadays.
He laid down the paper. On the wall opposite,
in the gilded oval frame, was the picture of Mrs.
Thaddeus Bourn, not in reality a mythical
person at all, and yet there was a certain indistinctness
in Thaddeus's memory of her&mdash;a
certain absence of salient points. She had not,
perhaps, been characterized by earnestness and
energy. But nowadays&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't bother me, Morgan," said Helen, impatiently.
They were in the drawing-room,
not far from the curtained door.</p>

<p>"But we start next week&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That," murmured Thaddeus, "is not, in
point of fact, such a bad idea."</p>

<p>"And now, Nellie, I think it would be better
if every one knew what you are to me before I
left. I'll tell you why I didn't want it before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's funny, but you never take the trouble
to ask what you are to me."</p>

<p>There was a silence that suggested threats.
As far as Thaddeus could make out she had
seemed to speak quite coolly. "She won't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
lose her head. God bless her!" he thought;
"but&mdash;a&mdash;I think I'll step into this."</p>

<p>"If you're going to be subtle," said Morgan,
at last, with a new harshness and blare in his
voice, "I sha'n't understand it. It's perfectly
simple. I want you to tell your uncle&mdash;Well,
then, I will."</p>

<p>Thaddeus pulled the curtain and went
through.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon. I seem to be referred to."</p>

<p>Morgan turned where he stood. Helen sat
in a low chair before the sea-coal fire, and did
not look up or turn her head.</p>

<p>"I should have&mdash;if I had supposed the conversation
was to be of such a private nature&mdash;I
should have&mdash;a&mdash;signified my presence before.
As it is, I take the opportunity to observe
that your&mdash;a&mdash;importunity appears to
be unpleasant to Helen, to request that you&mdash;a&mdash;leave
her alone, and to state that&mdash;a&mdash;no
engagement between you will ever exist with
my consent or her mother's."</p>

<p>"It does exist."</p>

<p>"I doubt it. Have you, then, ever promised
to marry him, Helen?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember I was ever asked to."</p>

<p>Something like a flame went across Mor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>gan's
face, left red spots on it, and a glare in
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Helen!" The chandelier shook with his
voice and step. Helen did not move or look
at him. Thaddeus raised a deprecating hand.
"I must beg you not to shout in my house."
Morgan paused and concentrated. The natural
thing to do, the simple instinct, would be,
with one hand to crumple up this grinning
old idiot&mdash;tall stock and curled hair and all&mdash;stuff
him away somewhere, and carry off Helen
into the windy night, with her white dress and
blue ribbon around the throat. It seemed impossible,
even in an artificial age, that slim
creatures should dare to balk him. She stood
up quickly, and he caught her closely about the
shoulders with his arm.</p>

<p>"It's absolute nonsense&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please let me go, Morgan. I don't want to
fight."</p>

<p>"Tell your uncle you belong to me."</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Helen, do as I say!"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>Thaddeus pointed at Morgan's arm.</p>

<p>"Will you kindly&mdash;thank you."</p>

<p>Helen fled, through hall and up the stairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
a shimmer of white skirts past the hall lamp;
and in her room she leaned from the window
and let the rain drive against her face. Mrs.
Mavering's window threw a great bar into the
night. Morgan's voice below seemed to fill
the drawing-room, the hall, and came rolling
up the stair after her, in muttering pursuit.
She gave a half sob, listened a moment, and
began to laugh.</p>

<p>"I'm glad Uncle Tad has that row."</p>

<p>"I remember," said Thaddeus, amiably, "I
remember being&mdash;a&mdash;rejected once myself. It
was unpleasant, very unpleasant."</p>

<p>"Do you think a thing of seven years is going
to be thrown out like this? Do you think
I'm a man to put up with this kind of business?
Do you think I don't know Helen?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Thaddeus, "that you don't.
My dear fellow, you have made a curious
mistake, and yet&mdash;and yet quite logical. I am
charmed to say, quite such as I should have
predicted. You have treated a woman with a
certain contempt. You couldn't help it. It
expressed, if I may say so, the degree of your
culture. Nevertheless, a mistake. Deference,
deference&mdash;they like it. It belongs to them. It
is&mdash;a&mdash;their accumulated inheritance. Seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
years&mdash;at thirteen&mdash;but, my dear fellow, a
child! You announce your intention to a
growing girl, by whose&mdash;a&mdash;admiring worship
it is received with awe. You suppose she continues
to worship you in the same primitive
manner. You suppose your ownership and
property established, that it merely remains to
dictate and receive. How simple, how&mdash;pardon
me&mdash;characteristic! By the way, your father.
I recollect, had a singular opinion of you. I
am candid, you see. It appears to be your
faculty&mdash;remarkably so&mdash;to invite candor. If
I recollect, he thought, supposing you were in
some way blown up or ground up into small
fragments&mdash;some accident, some catastrophe&mdash;and
then fitted together carefully&mdash;supposing,
if I understood him, this process repeated sufficiently&mdash;you
might&mdash;but I doubt it&mdash;a&mdash;paternal
weakness. But as to the situation at
present, I cannot conceal my&mdash;a&mdash;satisfaction."</p>

<p>Morgan glowered under reddish-yellow brows,
and Thaddeus talked on with persistent amiability.
So grim and forcible looked Morgan,
so likely to be summary or primitive inaction,
that it seemed to argue for Thaddeus a fine
trust in the strength of social restraint, his
continuing that airy, provocative speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"A distinction arises&mdash;a child, a woman. It
arose in Helen, no doubt, during her sickness.
You observed the distinction, I presume, but
only from its effect on you. But, really, you
know, it must have affected her. I have, in
my time, studied the sex&mdash;a subject of delightful
interest."</p>

<p>"I don't pretend to take interest in your delights."
Morgan had grown cool.</p>

<p>"Quite so," murmured Thaddeus.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, and enjoy them. I suggest you
don't interfere with me. I want Helen and
will have her. There is a bond&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Allow me. Has been, perhaps, an understanding
assumed."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to quibble with words."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Whatever there has been, or been
assumed to be, quite clear, no longer is&mdash;is
no longer assumed. I believe I speak with
authority."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to quibble about your authority,
either. You can flutter it as much as
you please. I'll see Helen alone."</p>

<p>"Not to-night. A&mdash;a little flutter of authority.
You leave next week? I shall not,
perhaps, take the trouble to prevent your seeing
Helen. I shall take the trouble to see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
nothing comes of it. My dear boy, I'm extremely
sorry. I don't like you. Your invitation
to candor is irresistible."</p>

<p>Morgan laughed shortly, turned, and went
into the hall. Thaddeus followed.</p>

<p>"Really, it's raining. Let me lend you&mdash;but
a soldier, of course&mdash;what a blessing is
youth! Exit!"&mdash;to the now closed outer door&mdash;"exit
the primitive."</p>

<p>And so spring came to an end, with a warm
rain murmuring on the roofs all night, soaking
down the roots of the maples, driving part of the
Third Regiment to sleep in the grand-stands.
As in sleeping Hamilton no one knew another's
dream, so almost as little by lamp-light or at
dawn did any watcher truly imagine another's
thought. Who shall escape the dungeon of
himself? The policeman on the corner of
Shannon Street and Philip's road, when
Morgan rushed by him, sympathized with an
apparent hurry to get out of the comfortless
rain. Thaddeus, before his sea-coal fire, plotted
such happy paths for Helen to walk in as an
enlightened egoism showed would be best for
Thaddeus. Helen let the rain drive in her face,
and thought that, "if people never meet again,
never will be a long, long time." Gard stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
in the middle of his study, looked around him,
whistled "The Campbells Are Coming," and
called it clearing up. Books, music, piano,
chairs, and memories of meditations&mdash;he thought
he did not care much what became of them.
There was a new time coming, and time it came.
"This is no world to play with mammets and
to tilt with lips. We must have bloody noses
and cracked crowns." "The Campbells are
coming&mdash;trala! trala!" Mrs. Mavering drew
the rope of her long black hair over her shoulder,
smoothed it on her knee, and thought of
the terms "commission" and "estates in happiness."
The braid was thick and glossy. It
seemed hard if her own play were quite ended
and story told. What, nothing more! Restlessness
must come from overbrooding, or the
new stir of the times. A woman's story ended
too soon. What a melancholy noise the rain
made!</p>

<p>Who shall escape the dungeon of himself,
or look from its clouded windows through the
clouded windows even of that one which lies
nearest, where another prisoner strains to see?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XI" id="Chapter_XI">Chapter XI</a>
<br /><br />
<small>The Whirlpool.&mdash;Mr. Paulus's Reminiscences of Women.</small></h2>

<p>The Third Regiment went its way. Visibly,
it resembled swarms of bees when last seen
clinging to the freight cars, or an excited picnic
with ornamental bayonets, but to a larger contemplation
rather a stream of sea-drift drawn
into the suck and roar of a growing whirlpool.
Men are noisy and cheerful, and seldom know
their own pathos. But the streets of Hamilton
seemed empty, though hardly fewer people
went to and fro; in the faces of women here and
there, there was a certain premonitory desolation.</p>

<p>Helen felt the emptiness to be extraordinary&mdash;unexpected;
an emptiness between her and
the sky; rooms mysteriously disfurnished;
things that people said sounding hollow, as if
the meaning of words had fallen away from
beneath them; Saint Mary's at night became
silent and dark, except for now and then a
droning service without palaces or towers of
sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"To what end," reflected Thaddeus, "am I
a student of human nature in the subtle sex?
If she doesn't miss that antediluvian brute.
I'm an addled egg."</p>

<p>"We're dreadfully dull, Lady Rachel, aren't
we?" said Helen. "Let's be Knights Hospitallers."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"All the rest do is to scrape lint and read
newspapers and potter. Why couldn't we
enlist and be nurses?"</p>

<p>"I dare say we could."</p>

<p>"With white caps and big cuffs? Could
we?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mavering wondered at Helen's influence
over her. She had watched it grow, with a
half-amused curiosity. She had thought to
be the girl's guide and helper, and that this
new interest would be her reward upon Thaddeus's
theory of commissions. But she had
seemed more and more to be following, not
leading; as if, in the actual onward game of
life, experience, instead of a lamp before, were
a lamp behind, darkening the path with the
shadow of ourselves. To remember only made
one irresolute. It was necessary to be young,
or else to forget&mdash;at any rate, to be valiant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
But had she not had enough of excitement,
adventure, the ragged seams of things, variety
and burlesque, and been soul-sick through it
all, and fled at last from its noise and passions?
She shook her head, not so much at Helen as
at the other side of her own inner argument.</p>

<p>"Collars and cuffs, Lady Rachel! But you'd
look beautiful!"</p>

<p>"That isn't what people want in nurses."</p>

<p>"It isn't? But it is! Why, if I were a man,
and had you around looking like a remorseful
queen who had just hung up her robe and
crown on the hat-rack, and was trying to be
humble with collars and cuffs, and all that, I'd
get well if I were shot criss-cross. I'd say,
'This world is too fine to leave.'"</p>

<p>"How should you know what you would do?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" She hesitated, and drooped a little.
"I think it was Gard said that." Then, with
returned animation: "He was so funny, Lady
Rachel. I asked him if he didn't think you
were all that, and he only said, 'This world
is too fine to leave; I think I'll stay quite a
while.'"</p>

<p>It did not all seem to Mrs. Mavering a direct
argument to go hospitalling; only it seemed
to fall in line with other questionings about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
fallen curtain, and whether it might not again
be raised. One might be content with a minor
part.</p>

<p>They went up to Hagar at the end of June,
and spent the blue-and-green summer together
in the widow's house behind the militant church.
Thaddeus came every Saturday, invented new
paradoxes, to watch them fall helplessly on the
widow's comprehension, and went down the hill
after tea in the wide sunset&mdash;an immaculate
gentleman, with eye-glass, cane, and smooth-shouldered
coat&mdash;to talk with Mr. Paulus.</p>

<p>"Ain't goin' to get married again, are
ye?"</p>

<p>"To whom, Peter? To whom?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. M&mdash;Mav&mdash;the one that looks like she
cost a dollar an inch."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mavering is, unfortunately, not as
yet a widow."</p>

<p>"He gone to the war? 'Tain't any more'n
reasonable she might get to be. Fine-lookin'
woman&mdash;looks expensive. Well, I done it
three times, an' then guessed I'd quit. I got
too fat&mdash;don't figure as well at weddin's as I
once did. But&mdash;Well, I don' no'&mdash;the women's
got in the habit of marryin' me."</p>

<p>"Pete," said Thaddeus, softly, "was not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
first time, in fact, the best? When one is
young!"</p>

<p>"Umm&mdash;She was&mdash;well, I'll tell ye. Old
Parson Gerry was here then, an' the candidest
man in Hamilton County, an' I went to him.
'Who is she?' says he. I says, 'Hilda Armitage.'
'Shucks!' says he, 'she won't have
you.' 'She will, too,' says I, pretty mad.
'Well, well, I'll marry you, but she ought've
done a sight better'n that.' But by-and-by
the parson and me was both widowers, an' I
went to him again. 'Who is she?' says he.
'Esther Allen.' 'Good land alive!' says he,
'I was going to ask her myself next week!'
An' he appeared to think Essie's bad luck was
odd&mdash;remarkable odd."</p>

<p>"I was asking, Peter, for reminiscences of
your young romance, tending on to your&mdash;a&mdash;doctrine
of practical matrimony, and so to
your theory of&mdash;of woman. We were at the
point of young romance. May I suggest&mdash;the
clergyman appears to take up too much
room. Hilda Armitage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, she was roomy, too. She began to
lay on flesh after we was married on
credit of a hundred acres of Wyantenaug
Valley land, came to her from Patton Armi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>tage,
till she took a six-by-four coffin, she
did, by&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pass on, Pete, pass on. Esther Allen&mdash;a&mdash;the
minister's preference would seem to have
argued in her a certain superior attractiveness,
a certain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jus' so. She argued it that way. She'd
never believe but what I knew the week the
parson had his eye on, an' sort of hurried up
and got in underhand. 'Twan't so," said Mr.
Paulus, earnestly. "'Twan't so. Didn't know
a thing about it till he&mdash;"</p>

<p>Thaddeus raised a white hand.</p>

<p>"I beg of you, no more."</p>

<p>In the matter of light on the "subtle sex,"
what opportunities for study had not Pete
Paulus thrown away! Mr. Paulus's drooping
left eyelid drooped lower. He heaved with a
rumbling chuckle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It would be not so evil a fate to come to Hagar
for the first time, bringing inward wounds to
its peculiar balsams. The blue flowers on the
green, the lilacs in Widow Bourn's garden.
Windless Mountain, that eclectic philosopher,
the deep wood avenues, the league length of
the Cattle Ridge, the eastern hills where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
church spire of Salem village might be seen&mdash;one
runs easily into cataloguing details, but
how convince the inexperienced of their significance,
their speech, their daily conversations?
Could the children of Hagar tell a stranger
the meaning of the mill stream, or ever really
explain the moral of the Four Roads? They
were not mere objects. They were tangled
with living years. One must have seen visions
and heard messages. One must have dropped
a salt tear by the road-side and sailed that
stream to the Celestial City.</p>

<p>And yet it was Mrs. Mavering who seemed
to hear the conversations, the meanings, the
messages, and not Thaddeus or Helen. Thaddeus
was never an instance in point, and Helen
was restless. Thaddeus speculated and commented
on that restlessness to Mrs. Mavering,
who offered few opinions. The impulse and
daring which Mrs. Mavering knew as characteristic
of Helen's speech seemed to have
turned from mental to physical energy, to
climbing cliffs instead of merely precipitous
ideas. It was as if speech were no longer expressive
of facts; as if both were learning an
unsyllabled language which the other knew
before&mdash;Mrs. Mavering learning the language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of the rocks and the soil, of growing and flowing
things, and Helen the language of human
living at a point in its syntax which deals with
the more searching idioms, the peculiar question
at which point is not merely, "What does
this obscure passage mean?" but, "What
does it mean to me?" The summer days
went like water-drops from the eaves after a
rain, that gather and shine and fall swiftly,
incessantly. September came, where the green
garment of the season runs into embroidery of
purple and gold.</p>

<p>The wood-path that runs west from the
Cattle Ridge road beyond Job Mather's mill
goes by a damp hollow where spotted fungi
grow, climbs past bramble patches, clearings,
and a bold strip or two of cliff, turns south
around a lonely pine-tree, the last of its fellows,
down through woods noted for lady-slippers in
June, and comes out on the hill meadows along
the Red Rock road. You can look south from
this wood's edge past the west shoulder of Windless
down the Wyantenaug, and to the east see
the range of the Great South woods, and near
by the spire of the militant church. But Helen
and Rachel came there, as a rule, for the sake of
the dominance and conversations of Windless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Helen lay on her back, with her hands under
her head and knees in the air. Mrs. Mavering's
book was thrown aside.</p>

<p>"Do you really want to go?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't know but I do. What will your
mother say?"</p>

<p>"'Why, Helen!'"</p>

<p>"And Mr. Bourn?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll sputter some. I don't mind."</p>

<p>Windless lay in the sunlight, genial, wise,
sincere, with the girth of high living and the
forehead of high thought. One did not have
to specify in the presence of Windless. Everything
was understood. Yet Mrs. Mavering asked.
"I suppose it isn't Morgan Map at all?"</p>

<p>Helen answered "No," promptly enough,
and fell into sombre silence. The eastern
slope of Windless darkened in the shadow of
the lessening afternoon, while the western only
seemed to glimmer the more genially; there
was that advantage in being large. "You
see," she went on, "it suits Morgan, fighting
and ordering and doing things. Nothing ever
hurts him. I don't see why I should bother
about him when he's having a good time."</p>

<p>"It's enough if you don't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Lady Rachel, then that's it. I don't."</p>

<p>"Then we won't say what it is?"</p>

<p>"No, please."</p>

<p>"But I suppose we can know?"</p>

<p>Helen rolled over with a laugh, and hid her
mouth a moment in the stubby grass.</p>

<p>"Let's go home."</p>

<p>Widow Bourn said, "Why, Helen!" immediately.
Thaddeus went with Rachel into the
garden, and walked beside her up and down
the path between the porch and the lilac
gate.</p>

<p>"It isn't Morgan Map. She doesn't bother
about him at all."</p>

<p>"She doesn't? Dear me!"</p>

<p>"But I think it might be better, after all."</p>

<p>"What is it, then? Why can't she be contented?
My dear lady, my poor intelligence
struggles with the subject, but you and Helen&mdash;hospitals,
drudgery, dirt, pah! vermin. I
knew she had the notion. I labelled it properly,
'Notion.' I was aware the Helen estate
was not returning the&mdash;a&mdash;interest it should.
I admit my commission from it has in consequence
this summer been very meagre&mdash;most
irregular. I believe I appreciate, I strive to
understand, your difficult sex&mdash;my lifelong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
endeavor&mdash;but at present, so to speak, if I
may say so, it 'gets me.'"</p>

<p>"Helen has perhaps more nervous energy
than is common."</p>

<p>"Nervous! But might we not almost say,
of late, feverish?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps we might."</p>

<p>"Then what&mdash;or rather, why?"</p>

<p>"If Helen had her secrets it would not follow
that she would confess them to me, and surely
you would know as quickly as I if she had
any. But if I have any intimation you must
let me keep it, and only say that, perhaps, it
would be good for her."</p>

<p>Thaddeus shrugged his shoulders, and went
down, immaculately, to the post-office to consult.</p>

<p>"Pete, the opportunities you've lost to study
women! But you might, possibly, say something
at random. What's all this for?"</p>

<p>Mr. Paulus's face was like the Sphinx's for
extent massiveness and lack of expression,
but his left eyelid was variable. He pondered
some moments. "What did you an' me steal
pigs for? Did we want the pigs? No. Did
we want to see Starr Atherton in his nightshirt?
Some&mdash;not much. Well, it was a way
we had of puttin' what was in our minds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
What's in will out. That girl'd bust out somewhere.
If it ain't measles, it's boils. That's
what I say. What's in will out."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whatsoever supplication or remonstrance
Thaddeus may have sent up by himself, he
took council of some inward monitor, and
did not "sputter." He had his reward from
Helen, who fell into a mood of tentative caressing.</p>

<p>In October they went to Washington. Thaddeus
sniffed a few weeks about the streets of
the capital, and returned to Hamilton, his
bank and club and lonely house, in a state of
mind to be expressed by a shrug and the lifting
of a white hand in deprecation. In his pursuit
of happiness the scent seemed to be lost, the
hunt all astray. He realized more than ever
how much of his fortune in that commodity
he had staked on one issue. He doubted, after
all, the wisdom of it, but could not find a way,
nor in himself any impulse, to draw back.
"The new generation, these new times! They
are strenuous, and one grows old." The air
was full of the war; the suck of the whirlpool
was felt in every corner.</p>

<small>Antietam.</small></h2>

<p>A big gun boomed far away in the dark.
From nearer came the snip-snap of picket-shooting,
which increased to a rattle and settled
into volleying. On the hill to the right some
one climbed on a gun-carriage and stood vaguely
against the sky.</p>

<p>Shadows came running from the door of a
barn into the grass. A sleeper cried out and
sat up at their feet, rubbing his trodden hand.</p>

<p>"What do you make it?"</p>

<p>"We have no troops over there. They're
shooting each other."</p>

<p>"Shooting their midnight dreams."</p>

<p>"Midnight! It's past three."</p>

<p>"How should I know? I was king of the
Pleiades five minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Time for trouble to begin?"</p>

<p>"It won't be light for an hour."</p>

<p>"No. Turn in, gentlemen."</p>

<p>Shadows sat upright in the grass and muttered
to each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the Pleiades, Jimmie?"</p>

<p>"Do' know. Wa'n't any at home as I know
of."</p>

<p>"Stars, you galoop."</p>

<p>"That's what the Johnnies were shooting
at."</p>

<p>"Hey! He must 'a' been jokin'," from the
shadow called Jimmie.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The cap'n said he was king of 'em, he
did."</p>

<p>"Oh, go to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't see any stars to-night."</p>

<p>The distant volleying died down to a rattle&mdash;to
the crack of a single rifle far away,
lonely in the immense night, the encircling
silence.</p>

<p>The woods went around behind the hill on
the right. On the left a grassy field stretched
off in the dark. One knew by remembrance
that it sloped down a gradual mile, till it came
somewhere to a slow creek with a mud bottom.
Outposts lay forward in a thin line of woods.
Some one said that the pickets were in an open
field beyond, and that some of them belonged
to the other side. In that tense, visionary
hour one did not conceive of an enemy as of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
separate men, watchful in fields, sleeping in
distant woods, but of a creature, a thing of
folded miles, crouching, sinister, hostile, with
red tongue and bitter fangs, waiting for the
dawn.</p>

<p>Some of the dark lumps in the grass were
motionless, some stirred and muttered. Through
the open door of the barn a group of men
could be seen around a lantern and leaning
forward. One of them marked and pointed
with his finger. A horse kicked and squealed
on the hill among the guns. A dog howled
in some indefinite distance and direction. The
birds began to twitter in the trees of the beetling
woods. A creeping wind chilled the dew
on the faces of sleepers and watchers in the
open. The blackness grew conscious&mdash;dimly
gray.</p>

<p>Two or three came out of the barn and ran
behind it. In a moment there was a cluttered
thudding of horses' feet, which died away down
the field. Pickets began shooting in front.
Little things whimpered and whined overhead.
An officer, by the glimmer of his straps, went
forward and shouted in the woods. The near
firing stopped, or most of it, but the things
overhead continued to whimper and whine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
The lumps on the grass began to sit up and
strip off blankets.</p>

<p>"What's he stopping 'em for?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in it."</p>

<p>"The Johnnies keep it up."</p>

<p>"They're firing high."</p>

<p>Fires of gathered dead-wood sprang up on
the woods' edge&mdash;a score in sight, then a hundred,
smoking and crackling. A low murmur,
a sense of multitude, grew as the darkness lifted
its oppression. Men sipped and munched by
the fires. Some one shouted, "Get ready, men!"
A cannon belched and bellowed on the hill
to the right, then another and another, to a
passionate, throbbing roar.</p>

<p>"Company B, forward! Halt here!"</p>

<p>Men poured around in crowds and formed in
triple lines. A shell dropped through the roof
of the empty barn and splintered some of the
boards outward with its burst.</p>

<p>The misty sky was breaking for a clear day.
Red clouds of sunrise streamed like pennants
in the southwest. A man in the front line
pitched forward and lay still.</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"I do' know."</p>

<p>"Aiken, I guess."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, now! You jabbed me twice. Hold
up your bayonet."</p>

<p>Men panted as if they had already been running,
and shifted their feet nervously.</p>

<p>"To-day's my birthday."</p>

<p>"Going to celebrate it all right."</p>

<p>Several laughed in high, strained cackles.</p>

<p>"What we waiting for, cap'n?"</p>

<p>"Don't know. Here. Where's your cartridge-belt?
Stay where you are. Who's
that down? Hand up his belt."</p>

<p>A shout came up the line, like the ripple
of a shaken rope. They were suddenly in
the woods. Men jumped from the ground and
joined. They were in another field of grass.
One heard nothing more but the thump of his
own feet and the singing blood in his ears;
not the throb of the artillery; not the cry of
the man who threw up his arms and fell against
him; not the discharge of his own rifle, though
he saw the smoke, and with the next stride his
face went through the smoke.</p>

<p>It was easy running in the grass, the long,
level fields, a fence now and then, a stone
wall; but then came a slope and ploughed
ground, where one stumbled and fell with his
face in the brown dirt, and fancied himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
hit in the pit of the stomach&mdash;only, why not
dead?&mdash;saw the lines gone on; got up, and
ran after to the edge of a field of standing corn.
A fenced road was beyond, a white building
with a central, squat chimney, overhung by
heavy woods full of smoke. The lower part of
the smoke bellied forward, jumped, and trembled
at the edge.</p>

<p>There seemed to be singularly few in the
running line now. One seemed, in fact, to be
running back unaccountably, down the slope
and the ploughed ground, into another triple
line, a surf of guns, caps, hot faces, and innumerable
legs. One seemed to be caught up
and rushed back, ploughed ground and slope,
and lined up at the top, there loading and
firing across the corn. Comparatively it was
restful, mechanical. To find one's cartridge-belt
empty at last was a disappointment. It
seemed to imply the need of doing something
else, something new and untried. The smoke
in the woods ahead was thinner.</p>

<p>"I guess Johnnie's belt's empty, too."</p>

<p>"I guess we're going in to see. Here we
go!"</p>

<p>They ran into the corn. One did not feel
military&mdash;rather, happy-go-lucky. The enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
behind the fence and in the road all ran away
to the woods, where there seemed nothing much
going on. It looked like a gaping mouth, the
tree-trunks like black teeth, and the smoke
from the blacker throat drifted between the
teeth. It seemed to have sucked in its hot
breath and red tongue&mdash;to be waiting. The
fence was nearly reached when it let go a
thousand red tongues, a voice that crashed, a
breath that was hot and smoky, that jumped
and trembled. One dropped behind the fence
and felt for cartridges.</p>

<p>"Hi, Jimmie! Going to get out o' this."</p>

<p>"Close up, men. Steady there."</p>

<p>"That's the colonel."</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"Draw them off, now. Steady. Close up."</p>

<p>"Belts, boys&mdash;look for belts."</p>

<p>They went back slowly, stripping the cartridge-belts
from men fallen between the corn-hills,
and firing at the smoke; into the grass,
at length, and at length to a halt in cover of
broken fence and line of weeds, hard by the
woods they had left at dawn. The enemy
spread over the cornfield. One seemed to
resent it on account of owning that cornfield
with a more than ancestral heritage. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
were fresh columns coming up on the right.
The broken brigades in the grass watched
them pass. Their line mounted and stood
still on the ridge, outlined against the woods
and volleying evenly. Gaps opened and closed.
Some one said, "They're old troops." They
went into the corn with a rush. Whatever
happened, it sounded like an explosion of a
half-hour's length, and after it the cornfield and
ploughed land were empty, except for the
smoke, and the wounded and dead, some hidden
in the corn, some seen against the brown fallow.</p>

<p>The mouth of the black woods gaped; there
were its black teeth and drifting breath. Fragments
of the columns were drawing off to the
covert of a bulge of woods on the right. That
part of the battle stood still. The sun was
half-way up the sky.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I fought, cap'n! I wasn't afraid!"</p>

<p>He had red, downy cheeks, an indistinct
nose, and white eyelashes.</p>

<p>"Terrible warrior you are, Jimmie. Your
fingers are dripping."</p>

<p>Jimmie looked at his hand. A little red
brook ran down the palm. He turned white
and sick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Scratched, Jimmie. Tie it up for him."</p>

<p>"I never seen it," in an awed voice.</p>

<p>The officer went on.</p>

<p>"Get your breath. See your guns are all
right. What's that?"</p>

<p>The man sat staring at his wrecked and
twisted rifle. Another man laughed hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Scrap-iron he picked up."</p>

<p>"'Tain't, either"&mdash;angrily. "It's my rifle.
Been holding it all day. What's gone with it?
Something hit it."</p>

<p>It had been shattered in his hands by a flying
missile.</p>

<p>Some one rode up whom the captain saluted.</p>

<p>"How many left here?"</p>

<p>"About forty."</p>

<p>"Colonel Morley?"</p>

<p>"In the cornfield."</p>

<p>"Major Cutting?"</p>

<p>"All right, sir, over there."</p>

<p>"How are your men?"</p>

<p>"Pretty fair, sir. They'll go in again."</p>

<p>A mile down the valley the fight was growing
hotter; a ravine was full of smoke, a jam
around a bridge, a line of blue hills beyond;
up nearer, columns were massing by a sunken
road, under batteries playing from opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
hills across the creek; a village lay to the west.
The sun made another jump up the sky. The
fields around were empty, except for the lines
in covert behind the fences, and here and there
a horseman galloping, here and there a horse
but no horseman. The enemy were in the
corn again, shooting intermittently. Smoke
drifted up and turned white against the glistening
blue. The batteries beyond the woods on
the right broke out again. New clouds of
smoke floated overhead and dimmed the sun.
In the grass-fields still the crouched lines waited
in covert of weeds and fences. Hours that
had shot past in the charge, the struggle and
retreat, now stretched like sleepless nights.
Company B muttered and swore.</p>

<p>"What's the use of waiting?"</p>

<p>"Le's go in!"</p>

<p>The captain and lieutenant lay at a distance
on the grass. Neither of them answered.
Jimmie felt around his belt.</p>

<p>"I got fifteen cartridges."</p>

<p>"How's your scratch, Jimmie?"</p>

<p>"Ho, I don' care for that. Why don' we
fight some more?"</p>

<p>The captain said, "Do you hear those minie-balls?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>The lieutenant, "What of them?"</p>

<p>"The pitch, of course; they go from E flat to
F, and then drop to D. That's a very pretty
interval."</p>

<p>"You've got an ear! They do sort of go up
and down."</p>

<p>"Le's fight some more."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimmie, dry up!"</p>

<p>High noon over the corn, and the woods, and
the white building with the squat chimney.</p>

<p>Jimmie again. "Le's fight so&mdash;Oh!"</p>

<p>He leaped, flung up his hands and fell&mdash;his
rifle clattering behind&mdash;his head rolled over
once and lay still. The man next him lifted
Jimmie's head, laid it down gently and turned
away. Some one farther along said, "Pshaw!"
One still farther, "Who's that?"&mdash;"Jimmie"&mdash;"Oh!"</p>

<p>The captain took the rifle and belt with fifteen
counted cartridges and walked down the line
to the man with the shattered rifle.</p>

<p>"Here you are."</p>

<p>Company B was silent, and crouched more
closely. The sun slipped down perceptibly
and burned red in the smoke. The throb of
the unseen guns grew Quicker. From woods'
edge and cornfield, from covered lines in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
weeds by zigzag fences, the smoke was living
and leaping, Company B busy and interested.
A horseman clattered by. "Get ready!"</p>

<p>"Bayonets?"</p>

<p>"All right. Get into it now!"</p>

<p>Grass-fields, fences, and ploughed ground;
all voices of the battle-field awake; yelling and
cheering, crash of musketry, crack of rifles,
roar of guns, shells that whooped in flight and
burst into a score of individual screams. Beneath
all, an undertone, a rumbling, grinding,
splintering sound, the organ bass of the field;
into the corn, that rustled as before, that brushed
in turn against Northern and Southern faces,
that sheltered alike from the slant sun all still
faces in the furrows, pale and ghastly and
grimed, thick together, piled dead over dead.
Then came the fence, the road, the squat-chimneyed
building, the gaping woods with black
teeth and white breath; and Company B.
Reg. Third, went into the wished-for woods
at last, with empty belts and point-on bayonets;
went through them, and saw the sun beyond, and
broken lines running across open fields. Some
thirty of them came back and sat down by the
white building gloomily. The captain looked
them over and hummed. "The Campbells are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
coming&mdash;trala, trala." The sun dropped low.
The throb of the guns down the valley grew
slower, duller, fainter. Sanitary men with
stretchers pushed to and fro in the corn. The
woods grew dark, the fields dusky. Campfires
crackled beside the road, Company B's
by the white building. Tin cups were poked
into the coals. Conversation was grumbling,
fragmentary.</p>

<p>"Jimmie's shut down on pretty sudden."</p>

<p>"Jimmie! There's fifty better men out of this
company dropped in their tracks! I don't see
why you're so cut on Jimmie."</p>

<p>"I wished it was some one else." The
speaker's voice broke. "He was such a damn
fool."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see."</p>

<p>"Know the name of that creek?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It's the Antietam."</p>

<p>"What of it? It ain't the Wyantenaug, that's
all I care."</p>

<p>"And this thing's a Dunker church."</p>

<p>"You got more useless information 'n would
set up a college."</p>

<p>"Pennsylvania fellow told me over there
Dunkers are sort of Dutch Baptists."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, go get some wood!"</p>

<p>The captain was in the road. He walked
over and leaned on the splintered fence and
watched the red lights of a hundred little fires
play ghostly games with black shadows in the
foliage of the woods. Men were pushing
about in the corn, rustling the blades. The
stars were out, the young moon setting slim
and lovely with the old moon on her arm. The
distant crackle of rifles, belated fragments of
the battle, seemed futile, isolated, mistaken
and sad in the light of the drooping, withdrawing
moon.</p>

<p>Fifty feet away was a large camp-fire of
fence rails. Of the men about it, one had lean,
long limbs and face, wore a long black coat
and black slouched hat, and talked continuously
in solemn, flowing bass. The rest listened,
absorbed. Now and then one of them laughed.</p>

<p>The captain drew near. The lean talker
unfolded his legs and rose.</p>

<p>"Gods! The anchorite? Gentlemen, who
might this be?"</p>

<p>"Cap'n Windham, Company B," said some
one.</p>

<p>"He hath grown a beard! In complete steel,
revisits the glimpses of the moon! A Hotspur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of the North, will kill him six or seven dozen
Confederates before breakfast and say, 'Fie
on this quiet life!' Will tootle a reed no more!
Will dive into the bottom of the deep, pluck
up drowned honor by the locks, and call it
vanity! Vat for a fool of a musician!"</p>

<p>"How are you, Jack?"</p>

<p>"A war correspondent I, John Roland Mavering,
who will celebrate you, a Homer to Achilles,
who wants to know for his invocation how you
happen not to be dead."</p>

<p>They locked arms and sauntered along the
road in leisurely pursuit of the moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XIII" id="Chapter_XIII">Chapter XIII</a>
<br /><br />
<small>In Which Appears a General of Division, and One of
"the Brethren."</small></h2>

<p>If Gard entered the war, as he claimed, in
the theory of a spiritual adventure, it must be
hinted that he had sometimes lost sight of his
theory. Outside events had shown a tendency
to usurp and absorb in the process of the happening.
It was not so noticeable during the
first nine months. He marched, drilled, felt
the rain and the cold wind at night in the open,
heard the enemy's guns, saw bleeding men
carried by from the distant field, and shared
in what was called "the defence of Washington,"
a matter that did not seem difficult or
exciting beyond reason. He was made a
sergeant&mdash;a purely outside event. There was
leisure to watch the scene, to keep one's poise,
to experiment with existence. If at times his
old sense of separateness, of isolation among
objects, scenes, and persons whose importance
to him was only in their inner effect upon him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
&mdash;if this sense at times seemed less vivid than
before, and the movements of men in masses,
the common enthusiasms, made him feel that
his solitary journeying was in some mystical
way accompanied by watching myriads with
the same forward step and shadowy goal, it
was rather a passing, a recurrent sensation.</p>

<p>But with the middle of spring came three
months of storm and stress in the Virginia
peninsula. He came out of the ranks by
reason of some inscrutable opinion of him conceived
and reported to authorities&mdash;something
connected with an expedition through a swamp&mdash;was
promoted because there were no other
officers to speak of in the company when the
army reached its new base at last on the James
River.</p>

<p>He looked back curiously now to the tumult
of those weeks, a period when he could not
remember to have remembered himself, a long
night of irrelevant dreams, the sense of identity
lost in the dull confusion, himself going and
coming, ordering and obeying, seeing difficulties
and finding solutions with a set of
surface faculties, the soul within him torpid,
at least taciturn. The experience had left
him with a sense of distaste and humiliation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
with a certain troubled doubt. Was a man captain
of himself, if he could be seized, stunned,
drowned in circumstance, lost like a drop of
water in a flood, rendered indistinct to his own
consciousness from the flowing, pouring mass
around him?</p>

<p>Gard did not suppose himself to be unique.
He supposed other men had similar paths to
walk in, pilgrim fashion; that every man
owned merely himself and his destiny, his
issue in the nature of things his own; that to
every man there was but one great distinction,
it lying between himself and what was not
himself. In his own age, at least, he supposed
it a growing tendency for men to look within
their own souls for the infinite which they could
not find without.</p>

<p>There was no doubt the peninsular campaign
had been an experience affecting him
profoundly. It had shown him what a pit of
danger lay on the side of such absorption;
that to plunge into affairs so intense, so physical,
so powerful in their sweep and pull, was
for the individualist numbing, miasmic, clouding
the eye whose function should be to see
one path clearly. It had given him a new
sense and a certain dread of the strength of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
what lay on the other side of that distinction
between himself and the not himself. It had
left in him, he fancied, a kind of sediment, an
element in respect to which it became illustrated
that what a man has experienced is a part of
him. It had made him perhaps more consciously
watchful of his poise, his mental
erectness and control. But the main result
so far had been that sense of uncertainty and
troubled doubt, as if he had lost the trail, as
if much had grown dim that was once definite
and guiding. Mavering's appearance seemed to
suggest something, a clew or an omen. Jack,
at least, was individual, nomadic, and distinct.
He never let his surroundings grow into him.</p>

<p>Thursday, the day after the battle, the hills,
woods, and fields were quiet except for stray
picket shooting. The two armies could feel
each other. Why they lay all day so near, so
quiet, was no business of either's subordinate
atoms. Gard felt that he but barely cared,
if no more was asked of him and his remnant
of thirty than to stay where they were. No
doubt they also serve who wait. He could
stretch in the sunlight, listen to Mavering's
home despatches, choice, flowing, vehement,
and supply him with technical language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>Farmers drove in on the road during the
day, and distributed apples from their wagons,
or peddled home-made bread. A number of
them wore singular, broad-brimmed hats,
smooth hair, long, and parted in the middle,
shaven lips and long beards below, and some
spoke broken English with an odd, German
dialect. They were said to be the Dunkers of
the squat-chimneyed church, now spotted
with bullet-holes, one casement blown in.
To Gard they seemed to illustrate grimly the
shaping power of externals, these men whose
mouths were set to the line of their wide hats,
hair plastered smoothly to mark the even tenor
of their peace. They called themselves "The
Brethren." There was something in their
faces at once a reminder of and a contrast to
the faces he remembered in the Brotherhood of
Consolation.</p>

<p>The camp-fires flickered once more at night
against the black foliage.</p>

<p>Company B, in a new manner, admired its
captain and the extraordinary correspondent,
while they recited Brutus and Cassius with
mellow mouthings, and after gave impromptu
dialogues between a Dunker advocating the
use of apples with Biblical extracts, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
general of division, explosive, impatient, dropping
oaths like solid round shot. Other men
left their own camp-fires and crowded the road.
Some officers sat on the fence and applauded.
The distant crack of the pickets' rifles was
sometimes heard, stabbing blindly at the night.
The stars were brilliant and the slim moon
was in the south.</p>

<p>Friday morning it was rumored that the
enemy had slipped away in the night, and
gone across the Potomac again; that the general
of division had been heard putting violent
terms to the name of his chief for committing
all the sins of omission which man could commit,
seeing his aides' enjoyment of which language
he had reddened and set his grim mouth.
The fields beyond the wood, at least, were
empty, and the village among the hills. One
could walk abroad without being shot at from
the bushes where those scarlet berries grew.</p>

<p>The crippled Third, with its odds and ends
of companies, moved as far as the village, now
turned a bustling hospital, and heard big guns
booming again south of the Potomac. There
it was that Mavering wrote that sketch of red
death and amputation which his paper expurgated
before publishing, to Mavering's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
disgust. "As fine a bit of realism as was ever
done! And look at it, butchered to make a
civilian holiday!" He read the first draft to
Gard.</p>

<p>"I'll trade my job for yours, Jack."</p>

<p>"Quite the contrary"&mdash;Mavering altered an
adjective in his copy&mdash;"you will not."</p>

<p>A messenger rode into the camp of the crippled
Third with a led horse.</p>

<p>"Captain Windham?"</p>

<p>"Here."</p>

<p>"Order of&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;; relieved indefinitely. Will
take this horse&mdash;report at division headquarters,"
and the messenger clattered away. Mavering
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"I'll trade you."</p>

<p>"Quite the contrary, you will not."</p>

<p>Mavering grumbled and went back to his
copy.</p>

<p>"It's that elegant comedy last night. Poor
boy! Ruined! Ruined!"</p>

<p>Gard rode down the road that led from the
village to the creek. The centre of Wednesday's
fight had been here, but the fighting
must have been mainly on the wings. There
were signs of heavy artillery work, but little
else. Beyond the bridge was a large house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
on the hill, with a white picket fence around it.
From the hill he could look up the winding
creek, and see the bluffs, the sloped fields
and ploughed ground of Wednesday's charges
and retreats, the Dunker church against the
woods. Some men in front of the house directed
him to take the right fork of the road. The
sun was low, the day-moon like a white scallop
of cloud. He found the headquarters a half-mile
beyond, a small brick house, distinguished
by the number of saddled horses fastened at
the fence, and within the general, a familiar
figure enough, with his red face and white
whiskers, a hot-tempered man and well beloved,
now puffing a cigar and quite self-controlled.</p>

<p>"Captain Windham."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen!" cried the general, "will you
allow me&mdash;I want to see this man," and they
were presently alone.</p>

<p>The general leaned back and looked at Gard
critically. He began:</p>

<p>"Captain Windham&mdash;mm&mdash;these theatrical
performances by officers for the entertainment
of privates&mdash;umm&mdash;this disgraceful mimicry of&mdash;mm&mdash;myself&mdash;this
disrespect leading to insubordination&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir. It was not intended&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was about to say," thundered the general,
"when you interrupted me, that I don't believe
the commander-in-chief would approve. Personally.
I'd have given something to be there.
I have about me, I believe, another cigar.
Sit down."</p>

<p>He spoke in a jerky way, coming down on
selected words with emphasis.</p>

<p>"I have need of a particular kind of a man.
It occurs to me you may be that kind&mdash;mm&mdash;a
certain <i>variety</i>, perhaps, of talent. It's
a bit of secret service. <i>Well</i>, now look here.
It is this. The War Department wants private
information about the actual effective <i>numbers</i>&mdash;if
possible&mdash;and <i>condition</i>, of the enemy&mdash;at
present. I will tell you more. The
estimates that come to it from the commander-in-chief
are&mdash;I quote the word&mdash;'<i>contradictory</i>.'
It is <i>suspected</i> that those estimates depend&mdash;I
still quote&mdash;'on the <i>impression</i> that
gentleman wishes to make on the department
or the public.' The suspicion may be wrong;
or it may be that a change is going to be made
in commanders; or, at <i>any rate</i>, 'before issuing
a definite order to the present commander'&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>it
needs information independent of the regular
source. <i>Do</i> you understand?"</p>

<p>"So far as you've gone, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;mm&mdash;exactly. That's right. No doubt
it is procuring other sources. That's no business
of ours. I've been asked&mdash;<i>confidentially</i>&mdash;to
furnish one source&mdash;mm&mdash;The
impersonation of Dunker elders and generals
of divisions implies&mdash;mm&mdash;also I know your
record&mdash;mm&mdash;<i>Captain Windham</i>, I am at the
present moment guilty of insubordination and
treachery to my superior officer. I am also
giving away what amounts perhaps to a state
secret. I am doing so&mdash;for the reason&mdash;that
your discretion must be relied on, anyway,
and you cannot understand too clearly the
point to be gained. This information must
reach either <i>me</i>, or the <i>department</i> directly&mdash;preferably
the latter&mdash;and <i>no one else</i>. You
see the point?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Preferably the latter. I needn't be connected
with it hereafter&mdash;would rather not be."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"Very good. This information should be
had as soon as possible. In case you have to
send a <i>message</i>, this paper contains a code,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
simple enough. The meaning depends on
the position of the words. You can apparently
mean anything you choose. Learn, and destroy
paper. So much for <i>that</i>. Your name
will be known at the department. You are
at your own disposition till the thing is done.
There are no directions. Now&mdash;one moment&mdash;this
map. Lee and Longstreet are probably
here. Somebody is, anyway. Jackson
is God knows where&mdash;possibly there. If so,
he'll be somewhere else to-morrow. Here's
your pass. Any questions?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"That's all, then. You may go&mdash;mm&mdash;Captain
Windham&mdash;some time I should like to
see the impersonation of a general of division
in a state of excitement. Hem! hem! Good-day,
sir."</p>

<p>Gard galloped through the little village in
the dusk, looking for Mavering, and found the
fields beyond empty. The brigade was gone,
the Third gone with it.</p>

<p>"I can't chase after him all night," he
thought, impatiently. "Why doesn't he stay
where he'd be useful?"</p>

<p>He caught sight of a horse fastened to a
maple-tree up the road.</p>

<p>Mavering lay on his back under the maple,
smoking.</p>

<p>"Get up. Come along."</p>

<p>"This cigar is the worst&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get on your horse. I want you."</p>

<p>"What do I care what you want? I was
about to say, this cigar is the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Throw it away, then."</p>

<p>Mavering unfolded his legs and mounted,
grumbling.</p>

<p>"You're the blankedest, most egotistic anchorite
that ever petted his soul, not to say dosed
it allopathically with wars and red rebellions.
One question: Is there any copy in this?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"Just what I thought. Wherever a man
goes he finds selfishness."</p>

<p>They turned into the northern road, clattered
past the cornfield and the church. Gard continued:
"One of those Dunker farmers lives up
here half a mile. I want his clothes, his expression,
and his language, and his theology&mdash;the
whole outfit."</p>

<p>"Going to steal his most intimate properties.
Blanked immoral thing to do. All right,
go on."</p>

<p>"About copy. Anything that goes south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
of the Potomac will be apt to mean a rope for
me, and New York papers go south of the
Potomac."</p>

<p>"Egotistic still, but perspicuous. I see."</p>

<p>"It's between me and you and the Dunker."</p>

<p>"And that's a pretty combination!"</p>

<p>"Not a sign, Jack."</p>

<p>"Not a misplaced comma, not an agitated
phrase shall betray the mystery of this night.
Now, then. Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you! You'll have to make me up."</p>

<p>"And the Dunker?"</p>

<p>"They're all anti-slavery and non-combatant.
Besides, I picked an acquaintance with
this one yesterday."</p>

<p>The small, plain, whitewashed house, with its
whitewashed barn, stood close to the road and
shining in the moonlit dusk. An elderly man,
with smooth, gray hair falling to his collar,
shaven lips, and spade-shaped beard, came to
the door and stood there, mild, quiet, round-shouldered.</p>

<p>"Can we put up our horses here and pass
the night?"</p>

<p>He nodded and turned back into the room
without speaking, but left the door open.</p>

<p>They spent the evening talking with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
studying the while his outward make-up, his
manner and language, critically. He had a
certain gentle suggestiveness of his own, and
before they parted for the night brought out a
pair of saddle-bags and a large bundle of printed
sheets.</p>

<p>"De is tracts," he said, gently, "of religion."</p>

<p>"Good," said Mavering. "An ungodly army,
no doubt. Oh, I beg pardon!"</p>

<p>"De is not of de doctrine of the bruderen
only. De is Christian."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, Captain Windham was bred a
Catholic. He'll distribute them, and read some
himself."</p>

<p>The quiet elder seemed to have taken a shy
liking for Gard. He touched him softly on
the back of the hand.</p>

<p>"I hope you are a good man. I hope you
are not to die in what you do."</p>

<p>At daybreak they rode away westward,
making a wide circuit of the village, Gard with
his lips shaven, hair parted and plastered down,
and wearing the gentle old brother's waistcoat
that buttoned to the throat, his dingy
black coat and wide-brimmed hat. His saddle
was primitive, his bridle-bit rusty. Mavering's
experienced eye judged that he looked his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
part. Even the whiteness of his lips, where
the razor had gone, added to the impression
of calm and austere withdrawal. Was it
some lingering touch of the monastery? One
does not live without result during the formative
years, secluded between cool, white walls,
among unworldly lives. Mavering called him
"the anchorite," and swore the phrase still
truthful.</p>

<p>A glimpse of the Potomac between the hills;
a troop of Union cavalry breaking camp in a
meadow; clank and rattle of side-arms; men
gathering and packing kit; men sitting listlessly
in their saddles; a mounted officer in
the middle of the road, looking down towards
the Potomac&mdash;large, square-shouldered, and
massive. He turned in his saddle.</p>

<p>"Hold on here! Halt!"</p>

<p>Gard pulled up and looked at him under
drooped eyelids.</p>

<p>Mavering pushed between.</p>

<p>"Without circumlocution, Captain Map,
you're precisely what I'm looking for. Cavalry's
the thing for a correspondent. I have an
unsubstantial vision I used to know you in
Hamilton."</p>

<p>"That's all right. Who's this?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that's a Dunker brother. Got some
blanked tracts in his saddle-bags. Let me
join you?"</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is he?" His horse blocked the road
aggressively. He kept his eyes on Gard.</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;Mavering turned and surveyed
the "make-up" critically, complacently&mdash;"I
slept with him at his old man's last night.
If a twenty-minute Dutch prayer is any proof,
he's still in the faith of his fathers. I'm leaving
you here, brother."</p>

<p>Gard nodded, rode into the ditch with a face
conscientiously blank, mild, non-combatant,
and passed the obstacle. Morgan watched him
ambling leisurely away in the sunlight and
the dust. Mavering waited some time.</p>

<p>"Look here, captain. Did I understand
you laconically to insinuate I might accompany
and chronicle your glories?"</p>

<p>Morgan wheeled his horse slowly.</p>

<p>"I guess so. Yes, you may."</p>

<p>The road went around a sandy hummock
and disappeared. Gard did not look back.
Beyond the strip of the Potomac the Virginia
hills were blue and cool and peaceful.</p>

<p>Mavering meditated a disclosure. Still, whether
Morgan had recognized Gard, or for a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
had suspected it was he, or had only acted on
constitutional aggressiveness, it did not seem
likely in any case that he would chatter about
the matter. He could hold his tongue without
being warned. "It's none of my funeral."
Gard had precisely stated what he wanted.
Mavering remarked:</p>

<p>"That Dunker had a pass, if you'd asked for it&mdash;permit
to scatter his tracts wherever he liked."</p>

<p>But Morgan did not comment. Mavering
thought him likely to be dull company, and set
himself to making other acquaintance and
finding entertainment with experienced skill.</p>

<p>The troop filed out, formed loosely, and
clattered south. It occurred to Mavering that
they might overtake Gard. Down through
the narrow valleys they came at length to the
willow-fringed bank of the river, but he saw
the broad-brimmed hat nowhere. It seemed to
have vanished from the earth. Mavering concluded
his connection with it over. New
pastures of interest were before him. The
nomad owns no real estate in any one else.
His soul knows not title or tenure. He will be
folding his tent at daybreak and leaving the
night's oasis, and the sands drift over his
footprints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XIV" id="Chapter_XIV">Chapter XIV</a>
<br /><br />
<small>In which Mavering Concludes that Cavalry Officers
as a Class Are Eccentric and Deep</small></h2>

<p>The war suited Morgan. It was action in
simple terms of purpose and accomplishment.
It was sensible and genuine. There no man's
complicated trivial tastes and instincts needed
to be bothered about; he carried them at his
own risk and exercise; they were not in the
army lists. Orders were not disguised in
requests and reasons. The gradations and
shades, the cautions and compunctions, the
ten thousand odds and ends of ten thousand
years' accumulation for the most part were swept
away in bulk. Men battled with men and threw
off their shamming benevolences, showed what
they were, and enjoyed themselves in the burly
lust of struggle. The life satisfied at least
half of him to completion.</p>

<p>A fortnight before the late battle he had seen
Helen on the steps of the wooden warehouse,
that they used as a hospital and filled from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
wall to wall with blanketed cots. She had
looked pale, tired, and smiling. After a moment
she had flushed and broken away angrily.
And that night he had lain twenty miles off
with his troop in the open, a lot of blinking,
idiotic stars over him, and could not sleep, and
damned in disciplined order the ways of woman
and the impalpable barriers around them&mdash;Thaddeus
Bourn, for keeping his skinny
corpse unburied beyond the limit of reason or
utility; and Gard Windham to the discomfort
of the blistered stars.</p>

<p>There appeared to be another part of him
unsatisfied&mdash;hungry, rather, and hot on the
scent.</p>

<p>Had he not picked out Nellie long ago for
her pluck and sense, and a certain tingling challenge
in her&mdash;a girl fit for his hand to hold?
She suited him, fitted one part as a cavalry
raid fitted another. Very well. He would take
her. Any one that stood in the way would
be hurt, very likely; at any rate, taught better.
The squire and Thaddeus Bourn might be as
futile as they chose, it being no business of his.
They had had their day. Let them keep
out of the path of men who had still to live.
It was no great matter what they did. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
when it came to Nell's mooning about the
organ-player, with his theories and whining
tunes, and getting sick in hospitals&mdash;She
said that she hadn't seen him since winter,
which wasn't likely. She had turned red, and
broken away at that. Hospital nurse! What
a fool thing for Nell to do! Mrs. Mavering was
with her, and Jack Mavering travelled with
Windham. The Maverings might have made
up. Ten to one there was a game on, and
they fancied Morgan Map was that kind of a
fool.</p>

<p>The war filled a man's hands. Morgan
felt that the germ of his own career lay in these
days, and other business ought to wait if it
could. Windham must be off scouting in that
Dunker outfit, and might by good luck get
himself hung, only he was too clever.</p>

<p>Morgan turned in his saddle and looked back
for Mavering, who rode in the middle of the
cantering troop, and seemed to enjoy himself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Saturday, the end of the week after Antietam,
the troop rode westward along the line
of a railroad. The Confederates had been at
it, some of them within a day or two, for the
burned ties were still smoking. They had bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the rails by heating them in the middle and
twisting them around the trees. At regular
intervals were black circles of the fires and
charred ends of ties. It was too systematic
for guerillas.</p>

<p>"There," said a lieutenant to Mavering,
"you can write your papers there are twenty
or thirty miles of this, all done under the nose
of the chief."</p>

<p>"A vigilant, aggressive man, the latter, I infer,
is your matured opinion," said Mavering;
and the lieutenant replied, dryly, "Something
like that."</p>

<p>The sandy road-bed curved through woods
that must have been straggling and discouraged
in their green days, and now were black and
smoking, for the abandoned fires had spread.
The wind mourned through the desolation,
and blew thin veils and streamers of smoke
overhead.</p>

<p>"And no doubt Captain Map's opinion
coincides with yours in favor of activity and
vigilance."</p>

<p>"He's a hot-and-cool man to ride with. You
might write that we're on a line which was
burned through yesterday or the day before,
and just now a lot of hostile cavalry are cavort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>ing
round the neighborhood somewhere, likely
to drop on us any moment. We're out to find
about this line and that cavalry, and get back
if we can."</p>

<p>"I notice&mdash;a point that strikes an artist in
realistic description inevitably&mdash;that Captain
Map is calmly reading something as he rides.
Such things illustrate."</p>

<p>"His nerve? Oh, that's all right."</p>

<p>"But the artist's imagination proceeds.
Reading what? A newspaper? No, a written
sheet, which the wind blows about in his
hands. Perhaps instructions&mdash;or, better, a love
letter."</p>

<p>"Likely enough."</p>

<p>"They do more than illustrate. They fill
in the foreground with humanity against the
background of nature and event. You are
an army officer, lieutenant, unlessoned, uninspired,
unreflective, and may take the word of
one old in variety, that the gist of life lies in
men and women rather than in event, and that
men and women are more worthy of consideration
in persons than in masses. The play is
played in the foreground, and there is the plot
and the crisis and the solution; there the action
lies; practicable scenery left and right, prac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>ticable
mob of courtiers, soldiers, or peasants
in the rear&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Morgan pulled in his horse and flung up his
hand, the white paper fluttering in it. The
troop halted short, plunging and scattering
sand.</p>

<p>"Enter," observed Mavering, "a practicable
enemy, lieutenant, from a practicable wood."</p>

<p>A quarter of a mile away the sandy road-bed
curved and disappeared. A large body of
cavalry swung around it. Morgan shaded his
eyes with his hand and the fluttering paper.
The troops sat stiff and intent. He shouted
and wheeled his horse.</p>

<p>"Left wheel! Hard!"</p>

<p>Whirl, plunge, and shout. Mavering's horse
slipped on the sand-bank, lost footing, and
fell headlong into the ditch. Mavering struck
the opposite bank in a heap, unlimbered, and
came down with his feet across the horse's neck.
He seized the bridle, jumped, and tugged. The
troop was two hundred feet away, the squadron
a thousand. A white paper, blown by the
wind, danced and twinkled along in the sand.
He tugged harder, leaning forward, and caught
the paper, thinking, "That's Map's love-letter,"
heaved and shouted. The horse half rose;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
something went "thud" in his neck; he screamed
and dropped again. Another bullet whined
by Mavering's ear. He dropped the bridle&mdash;"I'm
done, then"&mdash;and saw Morgan two
hundred feet away, his horse halted and half
turned, lifting his revolver again. Mavering
dove down the sand, lay still in the ditch, and
heard the third bullet whine close by, an inch
from his ear, then the swift flight of Morgan's
horse and the coming thunder of the squadron.</p>

<p>"Blanked if I don't read his blanked letter!
What in&mdash;'Pass man wearing loose black
clothes, broad, stiff-brimmed hat, shaven lips,
black beard, smooth hair, of sect called Dunkers,
carrying saddle-bags, riding bay horse
with white forefoot, through all Union lines&mdash;bears
important information, give all facilities,
forward to Washington, signed&mdash;' And no
signature."</p>

<p>But the rattle and roar were at hand, and the
sense of a thousand horsemen about to charge
into the small of his back. He thought, "I'll
be searched in a minute," swept a handful of
sand over the paper, clambered up the bank
and sat on the burned turf above, hugging his
angular knees. The head horseman pulled
to the right and shouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Follow 'em half a mile, Cary, and wait
there."</p>

<p>The bulk of the squadron swept on.</p>

<p>"Search that man, you there! Pull that
paper out of the sand."</p>

<p>Mavering groaned disgustedly. Two men
were up the bank, feeling him all over with
skilled precision. The colonel pulled his chin-whisker
over the mysterious writing. "What's
all this?" Mavering sat down again and
brushed the sand from his trousers and long
black coat-tails. His hat lay in the ditch.
The troop remaining gathered in a semicircle,
the colonel and Mavering in the centre, with
ditch and the prostrate kicking horse between,
practicable scenery of a September sky and
burned woods around.</p>

<p>"I don't know, colonel," said Mavering, in
solemn and rhythmic bass, "but I judge it's a
job put up on you by the recondite and
taciturn captain of the troop lately departed.
He appeared to drop it with a policy and
plugged at me with a revolver when I picked
it up."</p>

<p>"You hid it, sir"&mdash;sharply.</p>

<p>"So I did. The truth is ever beautiful.
He plugged my horse. Supposing he meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
that for you, I'm not backing his game to-day.
It's too deep for me, anyhow."</p>

<p>A young officer broke in at the colonel's
elbow.</p>

<p>"Dunker? We passed that man Monday
up by the river, colonel. He was scattering
tracts."</p>

<p>"Did? Here, then&mdash;Martinsburg, or further
up! Go hard. Now, then, who are you?"</p>

<p>"Correspondent. You've got my credentials
with the rest of the loot, of which you might
lend me a dollar and a half and return the note-book
containing a half-written but masterly
article on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Note-book? Article? Very good. Do for
a Richmond paper. Credentials? Where&mdash;Oh!"</p>

<p>"Sign it J.R. Mavering, and tell 'em the
price is forty dollars."</p>

<p>The colonel was a small man, high-voiced,
quick-eyed, but not without a certain cheerfulness.
He glanced up from the papers with
an appreciative twinkle. The men slouched
easily in their saddles. The horses stamped
and shifted.</p>

<p>"Here! Give these back to him."</p>

<p>"Don't we take him, colonel?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. What for? Give him back everything.
All ready! Forward! Wait!" He
pulled up suddenly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mavering." The little colonel was
dignified.</p>

<p>Mavering pocketed his property calmly, as
if in the common flux of things, the flowing
change of time, scene, and event, it was not
strange, whatever went and came, or however
suddenly. Anyway, this world was a
fleeting show, an incessant comedy without
plot.</p>

<p>"Sir."</p>

<p>"Such Northern newspapers as yours, which
have&mdash;in the past, at least&mdash;been inclined to
criticise the unprovoked invasion of Virginia,
it is desired by the authorities that such newspapers
should be treated with consideration.
You follow me, sir?"</p>

<p>"With strict attention." Mavering leaned
forward, his hands on the burned turf. His
feet dangled against the bank.</p>

<p>"Distinguished consideration. You will mention
that attitude, no doubt."</p>

<p>"No doubt at all."</p>

<p>"Good-morning, sir."</p>

<p>"Good-morning, colonel."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>The troop departed with crowded thud of
hoofs and scatter of sand.</p>

<p>Mavering watched them out of sight, then
slid down the bank and picked up his hat.
He lifted the head of the prostrate horse, but
the eyes were dull, the throat full of blood;
unbuckled the bridle and slung it over his arm.
The long, yellow level of the road-bed to the
nearest curves was empty in both directions.
He was quite alone in the desolation. He muttered
and hummed in profoundest bass. "Singular
game&mdash;'Plaidie to the angry airt'&mdash;recondite,
astrological. Make a note of it;
cavalry officers as a class are eccentric and
deep. It's not my funeral. It appears to be
the anchorite's. 'The brightest jewel in my
crown'"&mdash;He crossed the road-bed, picked his
way eastward into the woods, long-stepping,
bridle on arm, gaunt and black, over the black
ground among the gaunt, black stumps of the
charred trees&mdash;"Wad be my queen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XV" id="Chapter_XV">Chapter XV</a>
<br /><br />
<small>Treats of the Distribution of Tracts in the Valley of
the Shenandoah.</small></h2>

<p>The Shenandoah goes by the eastern edge
of the wide valley, murmuring its own musical
name, "Shenandoah," as if it knew the word's
significance in glory, tumult, and pain, but
had taught all three to march to a quiet requiem;
"Shenandoah"&mdash;old, unhappy, far-off
things, under the lulling and palliation now of
many years.</p>

<p>Gard rode directly south, through plodding,
dusty lines of haggard-eyed men, and came
to it a few miles above the junction and the
famous Ferry. The cannon boomed all day on
his left over by the larger river. He rode by
daylight and openly and none seemed to
doubt him; his dress and little printed tracts
were passports enough for the time. He fell
into the habit, first by impulse and then by
policy, of carrying a tract in his hand, using
its subject and phraseology for the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
conversation and entering on the subject
promptly.</p>

<p>It gave him a sense of detachment and isolation
of a peculiar kind, this urging on some
weary and hurrying group a doctrine of peace,
compassion, and humility, as if the manner
and language were working inward and growing
less alien to him, and he really were a mysterious
evangelist&mdash;a messenger with spiritual
tidings and council. He noticed&mdash;and it seemed
from its recurrence to have a certain pathos&mdash;that,
after the laughter which rose around
him in most cases had subsided, the faces
would lose their weariness and strain, and
seem to express another side of their humanity.
They reminded him, then, of the fruit-seller and
the policeman on the avenue, where he used to
go to and from the Brotherhood of Consolation
and the Church of the Trinity, who recognized
in him some one apart and remote from the
current of events&mdash;the river of humanity on the
avenue.</p>

<p>It was even a more turbulent river that was
pouring west and southwest along the two railroads
leading from the Ferry. They were
beginning to tear up and burn the northern
line, but along the other the trains still moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
in puffing succession. To Gard the sense of
the part he played was strong almost to reality.
The quaint, biblical, old-world phrases which
he ever kept reading and repeating reacted
upon him. He seemed, even to himself, to
become intangible and apart.</p>

<p>"What shall a man take in exchange for his
soul?" halting his horse and taking out the
little white tract.</p>

<p>"I don't know. If you've got a plug of
tobacco I might trade."</p>

<p>"If I had any, friend, I would give it to you
freely."</p>

<p>The man looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"I reckon you would now. This the best
you know how, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Others who had stopped laughed and swarmed
around. "Give me one!" "Me one!"</p>

<p>"There are more who need them."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right."</p>

<p>"No hogs here."</p>

<p>"Good-luck to you, elder."</p>

<p>The stream flowed on, some chuckling over
their tracts, some silent. An officer said:</p>

<p>"You ought to get a pass, elder." So he
came to where the Shenandoah murmured its
musical name. A range of blue mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
rose beyond it. There seemed to be little going
on by the river. The retreat had shifted to
the west along the railroads into the Opequan
valley, and he turned and rode west among
low, wooded hills. It was Wednesday. They
were tearing and burning the southern of the
two railroads now&mdash;an endless row of bonfires
of the ties, the iron rails laid across them
to be heated for bending.</p>

<p>"'Let not your hearts be troubled.'"</p>

<p>A man bending over a rail drew his hand
back, swore lustily, and straightened up.</p>

<p>"What's that? Oh!" He took the tract.</p>

<p>"That's what it says, sure enough. Maybe
you don't know that rail was hot." The tract
was passed around. One read aloud, "He
hath taken charge and command. He hath established
His law."</p>

<p>Gard sat motionless on his horse, looking
placidly over their heads to the pale-blue horizon.</p>

<p>"Who is the one greatest in authority here?"</p>

<p>"This side of God Almighty and Winchester.
I reckon you mean the old man. Hi, lieutenant!"
The cantering officer pulled up.
"He wants the general."</p>

<p>"Does, does he? What for?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>A pause. Gard dropped his eyes to the
officer who was reading the tract.</p>

<p>"It is said to be best that I should have
his permission to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. Come along, then."</p>

<p>They rode beside the track through strata of
heat and smoke from the fires, Gard following.
It occurred to him that he had given his name
on an impulse the day before as Moselle, and
would possibly need it now. They came to a
group of horsemen, talking, except one in
front of them, who watched the toiling squads
silently. He wore a full black beard, and sat
his horse awkwardly.</p>

<p>"This seems to be some kind of a missionary,
general. He wants to see you."</p>

<p>The general glanced up under the brim of
his slouched hat; then suddenly flung back
his head, so that his big beard stood out from
his chest, and said, simply:</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I am directed by a Session of the Brethren
to distribute these."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Of a congregation in Maryland."</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Moselle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are the Brethren?"</p>

<p>"We are called Dunkers by those not of our
communion. We do not use the name."</p>

<p>"There was a church of that sect near Sharpsburg."</p>

<p>"It is our church."</p>

<p>"They seemed to be German. You have no
accent."</p>

<p>"It was said to be the reason I was chosen&mdash;the
speaking freely the language. It was said
at the Session."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>He dropped his eyes to the tract in his hand.</p>

<p>Gard remained placid, persistent.</p>

<p>"It was said a permission might be written."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>He wrote a few words on a scrap of paper
and handed it to Gard.</p>

<p>"May I keep this tract in exchange?"</p>

<p>"It is not exchanged. It is given."</p>

<p>Gard turned his horse. The general looked
up.</p>

<p>"You are a young man"&mdash;silence&mdash;"But
your sect takes no part in wars." Gard waited.
"Do you know the subject of this tract?"</p>

<p>"It is on the text, 'I must be about my Father's
business.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>The general seemed to have in mind to say
more. He looked at Gard peculiarly&mdash;not quite
as the others had seemed to do, half suspecting,
half recognizing an alien being, a moral and
mental unknown at some withdrawn height,
but as if recognizing one like himself in isolation
and pilgrimage, and so understanding his
bearing and capacity for silence.</p>

<p>The horsemen behind whispered and smiled.</p>

<p>"Very well." The general turned again to
the working squads, and Gard rode away in
the smoke that drifted from the fires across the
track. He had a sense, too, of some flash of
recognition that had gone below the part he
was playing, and seemed to involve a salutation
and question of other import and circumstance,
a recognition of kinship in the knowledge
of other realities than the feet walk upon
or the eyes see; knowledge of the silence out
of which one is born, of the flux of his present,
of destiny in ambush, of the "stream of the
flying constellations," and the steady pour of
time, "inhaled as a vapor;" knowledge of the
individual's own lonely issue in the midst of
these. But the turning again to his working
squads seemed to have been the general's
solution&mdash;or, at least, conclusion. "Very well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>;"
one must be about the business set him to do.
"He must work in his garden," had been more
than one sage's conclusion.</p>

<p>Gard did not entirely wish to work his way
back to the point of view that once had been his,
of a spectator of events, who only acted in them
in order to appreciate them vividly. He wished
to regain his old enthusiasm, the poise and the
clear sense of things, the interest, dulled since
the Peninsular campaign; and for the rest, to
go on to positions requiring new definitions.
So far as the general had served as a councillor,
he had seemed to advise attention to business,
to imply that there was personal value in simple
and direct doing.</p>

<p>During the two following days Gard rode
along the railroad to Winchester, and up and
down the Opequan valley, picking up information
and asking such questions as he
could make bear on the distribution of tracts.
Once or twice he thought he recognized a face
he had seen across the road by the Dunker
church. It was not impossible. But one could
not identify from such smoky glimpses.</p>

<p>On Saturday he left Winchester and went
eastward, crossing the Opequan where the turnpike
led by a shallow, rippling ford, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
flat-fenced meadows of the bottom lands were
all about. His saddle-bags were nearly empty,
and beyond the Blue Ridge he might find
means to send a message north.</p>

<p>A horseman was watering his horse at the
ford, his hat tipped back, a bandage around
his head. They greeted, and Gard handed him
a tract.</p>

<p>"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown."
It was one of the faces he seemed to have seen.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're that missionary they call 'Abstract
Piety.' Well, look here!"</p>

<p>He stopped and stared. Gard leaned forward
to let his horse drink, saw his own face
in the stream, and wondered what it might
mean to the man with the bandage who watched
him, and whom he had somewhere seen. It
might be a critical question, what his face
meant to the man with the bandage. Crises!
As one went on, every step was a crisis between
the moment past and the moment in front.
The current streaked the reflections in the water,
and there were little brown minnows holding
their heads up-stream. He noticed his own
expression in the reflection&mdash;the impassive
mask that he had come to wear without
effort, the spade-shaped beard, the lips whiter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
than the rest of the tanned skin, which might
suggest to the acute that the shaving of them
was recent, the swift curve of the hair-line,
the heavy eyelids over eyes that looked up
dreamily out of the wavering water. He
thought that, from an artistic standpoint, he
must look his part, or something like it, with an
emphasis. But every one travels by his own
road to his own conclusions. The man, whose
white bandage wavered and gleamed in the
water near his own reflection, reminded him of
one from whom he had taken a pistol in the
cornfield by the Dunker church, whose eyes
had been mad and glaring, and his hair soaked
in his own blood. In fact, that was the face.
Crises! Did it mean the sudden end of his
running days? Probably either his or the
other man's. Their reflections in the stream
seemed to parody them, to watch and mimic.
The water chuckled. There was something
ironic in things. One fancied the current of
time itself to be streaming and streaked yellow
in the sunlight, and full of bubbles. The
minnows poised and darted against the stream.</p>

<p>Gard's horse flung up his head with a start.</p>

<p>"If the message I have given you is not for
you, will you not give it to another?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>As he left the water he heard the other's
horse splashing behind him. The road turned
from the river through a sandy cut in the woods.
At the woods' edge the bandaged head was
beside him.</p>

<p>"Stranger, you don't happen to have that
gun about you you stole from me?"</p>

<p>Gard turned and looked into the small, black,
fatal circle of a pistol barrel, like an eye-socket
with the ball in ominous retreat.</p>

<p>"I do not carry weapons," he said, quietly.</p>

<p>"You don't! I reckon you do. You ought
to have plugged me down at the ford with one
of those weapons you don't carry. We're going
back."</p>

<p>"If you wish to take my life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd like to, mightily."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"You're a Yankee spy. Wheel around there
and keep ahead."</p>

<p>"This mistake delays me. I have permission&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep your hand out of your pocket."</p>

<p>Gard paused an instant, then said: "Very
well," and turned his horse slowly to the
right, shook his left foot from the stirrup,
and guided his horse close in. Their right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
shoulders almost touched. He gripped the
man's pistol-hand and throat with the same
movement. The pistol spat past his cheek.
He heaved, left foot in the saddle, and leaped.
The man gurgled, and they fell over his horse's
cruppers heavily in the road, the man below
on his bandaged head. The bandage fell off;
his blood trickled into the dust, and he lay still.
The horses had cantered apart.</p>

<p>Gard twisted his head around as he lay
athwart, looked an instant, and loosened his
hand from the black-bearded throat. The
grip was so hard and sinewy, it was like untying
a knot. It took effort, as if his muscles had
been screwed up and rusted in place. The
man was dead or stunned.</p>

<p>Gard got up with the pistol in his hand. He
brushed his own clothes, caught his horse,
sent the other's with a cut from a switch galloping
away into the woods, and came back.
He found cartridges and a glass flask full of
whiskey in the man's pockets, and put them in
his own. If not dead, perhaps he had better be;
otherwise one must change disguise, and proper
disguises were not easy. He slipped a cartridge
and cocked the trigger.</p>

<p>The sun above the trees shone on the livid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
face in the dust. It was about noon, and the
hour that Mavering stalked from the sandy
road-bed thirty miles away into the charred
forest and murmured: "It's not my funeral.
It appears to be the anchorite's."</p>

<p>On the whole, the neighborhood was too lively
for loose pistol-shooting. Gard lifted the limp
body and carried it into a thicket, brought the
bandage and laid it beside, kicked the dust
over the blood-pools in the road, mounted his
horse and smoothed his face, trying to settle its
placidity.</p>

<p>He trotted and cantered all the afternoon
northeastward among low hills, passing many
untroubled farm-yards, but little soldiery. A
couple of horsemen said, "Howdy, elder,"
and seemed to have met with him and his
mission before. He gave them one of his few
remaining tracts absent-mindedly, without answering,
came when the sun was low to the
Shenandoah, and heard it murmur its musical
name.</p>

<p>"Probably he'd been more convenient dead."</p>

<p>The bridge was burned. He swam his
horse through the current. The blue mountains
fronted him darkly against the sky.
The turnpike led up through a gap and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
over into the elder Virginia. It was dark
when he reached the end of the meadow lands
where the upward pitch and the woods of the
mountain road began. "Probably he'd be
handier that way."</p>

<p>At the top of the gap were open pastures, a
cabin where a dog barked, but no light shone
in the windows. The stars were out innumerably,
the valley behind in the cold, blue vapor
of the night.</p>

<p>"But it might be better to change the part,
after all," he thought; "better for luck."</p>

<p>Fortune might grow weary, a good mule be
overworked, a good tune sung too long; for
instance, the doxology was a good tune, two-four
time, the measure of the tread of the moral
law, a taciturn, single-minded tune, something
like the general who sat his horse awkwardly
by the burning railroad.</p>

<p>The moon that was slender and new at
Antietam had grown round as a shield and rose
late. Beyond the pastures on the gap the road
led down through the woods to the elder land
asleep in the moonrise.</p>

<p>"<i>Einst, O Wunder, einst</i>," the world and the
young man, the big wars, the stir of living!
And how wonderful then the moon and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
night's infinite valleys, the glory of being and
of loneliness, when to be a living soul was
royal and the splendor of the night was its
crown, when palpable currents, rivers thrilling
and divine, poured into it, as the universe
paid homage to its worth. Gard felt that he
had somewhere lost his resonance. He must
look for another coat and a happier disposition,
shave his beard and shake dice with chance
again. The road plunged down into the
cavern of the woods. He let his horse pick
his way, and judged the character of the road-bed
from the sound of his steps below in the
darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XVI" id="Chapter_XVI">Chapter XVI</a>
<br /><br />
<small>Which Discloses one Daddy Joe, and Disposes of an
Evangelist</small></h2>

<p>It was chilly at that height. Gard rode
all night down the mountain-side, and saw at
last the lights of moon and sunrise mingling
over the meadows and cornfields of a plantation
close below him. The forest grew thinner
and broke into clearing and pastures. He
left the highway by an old cart-road whose ruts
were grass-grown, though its centre was trodden
hard by many human feet, and passed an
empty building of rough boards&mdash;a school-house
or a negro church. The big chestnuts hung
over it, and underbrush grew up to its windows.
The path went to the door, swerved aside
through the thicket, and at last ran into a little,
lonely, hollow pasture, with the sunlight pouring
over its edge as into a cup. He picketed
his horse to a thin sapling that would bend
and let the horse eat, and lay down near a
bowlder where the sunlight seemed to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
yellowest, smiling to feel the warmth steal
through him. "There's too much luxury
in my bones for an evangelist." Presently
he was asleep. The sun mounted, swung
around by the south, and the shadow of the
bowlder went over the sleeper. An old negro,
with bowed head and cane in hand, stumped
vigorously along the path towards the building
under the chestnuts. He passed the bowlder
on the other side, and saw neither the sleeper
nor the horse picketed among the saplings and
feeding quietly. He wore a suit of fine broadcloth,
the coat lined with silk and stained and
threadbare, a white vest, a blue, dotted cravat,
and a soft, gray hat. After that the clearing
was silent except for passing crows and drowsy
insects.</p>

<p>Suddenly the woods became choral, a burst
of singing from the chestnut grove. Gard
started, sat up, and listened.</p>

<p>"That's no jingle! That's music!"</p>

<p>He jumped to his feet and ran across the
pasture, crept hurriedly through a thicket to
a window brushed by leaves of the underwood.
He was absorbed and eager.</p>

<p>"Man there with a voice like a bass viol!"
he muttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">I'd wade up stream to Galilee,</span>
<span class="i4">By Jordan."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Each verse boomed up a noble crescendo
and fell away in plaintive minor chords. The
preacher in the pulpit, in white vest, dotted
cravat, and fashionably cut coat, cried:</p>

<p>"Mou'n an' pray! Mou'n an' pray!"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>"De tex'," began the preacher, "is 'bout er

<p>The preacher swung his arms over his head
shouting:</p>

<p>"Jo'dan! Jo'dan! Ain' no shinin', ain' no
gladness, on'y 'yond Jo'dan! Ain' gwine be no
free niggeh! Ain' gwine be no slave! Gwine

<p>The congregation swayed, moaned, shouted:</p>

<p>"Jordan! Jordan!"</p>

<p>"Ain' I hyah de whippo'will cryin' de yevenin',
'Daddy Joe, come 'yond Jo'dan, Daddy

<p>"Amen!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now you shoutin'!"</p>

<p>From his ambush Gard could see the preacher
plainly through the window and two or three
of the swaying heads nearest the preacher.
The service from now on seemed like an incoherent
tumult, the preacher's voice now and
then above it, crying, "Mou'n an' pray!" until,
at last, after half an hour, it all died away, and
there was silence except for the sobbing, moaning,
and panting. The preacher had sat down,
or was not in sight from where Gard was hidden.
Some one unseen at the other end of the building
began to sing softly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">"There's a little wheel am turning in my heart."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Gradually the congregation dropped into the
melody, all singing softly.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">"There's a little wheel am turning in my heart,</span>
<span class="i4">In my heart, in my heart.</span>
<span class="i2">That little wheel am Jesus in my heart,</span>
<span class="i4">In my heart, in my heart&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">I don' want no deception in my heart."</span>
</div></div>

<p>There was a long prayer in a husky whisper.
The preacher seemed exhausted. The meeting
broke up. Gard counted fifty or more as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
came out. They all took the path to the highway,
except the preacher, who stumped away
towards the pasture. Gard waited till everything
was still, then stepped into the path and
followed him. When he came into the pasture
he saw the old man down by the bunch of
saplings, examining the horse, and joined him
promptly.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, friend."</p>

<p>"Mo'nin, sah; disher you ho'se, sah?"</p>

<p>Gard felt in the saddle-bags and found a
couple of tracts left.</p>

<p>"You do not know how to read? These
are two short sermons upon the texts, 'Whosoever
calleth his brother a fool is in danger of
hell-fire,' and 'He that loseth himself shall
find himself.' You live over there, in a cabin
by yourself?"</p>

<p>"Hey! Yes, sah."</p>

<p>"If you like I will go with you and read you
these sermons?"</p>

<p>They went up the pasture, and left the horse
feeding under the saplings.</p>

<p>The old man seemed awe-struck, as if he
thought Gard might be some such spiritual
stranger as visited the prophets of old and the
chosen servants of the Lord. He walked on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
looking up shyly at his sudden guest, who
went beside him, straight, slim, and sinewy,
with sun-tanned skin, shaven lips, silky black
beard, singular hat, with broad, stiff brim,
and did not, surely, in that garb at least, look
like other men. When they came to where
the path passed from the clearing into the
thicket again the negro stepped aside. Gard
motioned and said:</p>

<p>"After you, Daddy Joe."</p>

<p>"Ain' he know my name! Ain' he know
my name!"</p>

<p>The path led down and came out on the bank
of a creek, with old willows along it and a single
little cabin back of the willows in a meadow.
Across the creek were cornfields, and in the distance
the chimneys of a large plantation house.</p>

<p>Gard asked, "Have you something for me
to eat?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah. Yes, sah."</p>

<p>They sat down on a rickety bench at the
cabin door, and Gard read the two tracts while
Daddy Joe watched with troubled, pathetic
eyes, and after it brought out corn-bread and
bacon sizzling in a pan. The sunshine was
warm. Some bird whistled shrilly in the
willows over the brown, sluggish creek. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
smoke of the distant chimneys hung heavily.
Gard felt as if he would like to let his business
slide and watch for hours dreamily the hanging
smoke, and gather the sense of contrast between
the tumult of the times and spirit of the
settled land brooded over by memories of
generations at peace, of homes and familiar
things.</p>

<p>"Daddy Joe," he said, suddenly, "we must
work in our garden."</p>

<p>Daddy Joe seemed to think that normal
remarks were not to be expected from a visitant,
possibly heavenly, at any rate having intimate
knowledge and a message to deliver.</p>

<p>"Yes, sah. Da's a fac'. We must work
in de gyarden, sholy."</p>

<p>"I have something for you to do." He
stopped. Daddy Joe's sermon had seemed to
imply an adverse opinion to negro freedom.</p>

<p>"You are wrong, Daddy Joe. It would be
better for the slaves to be free."</p>

<p>"Fo' God!"</p>

<p>"You really think so yourself. This is
what you think, that it is meant they shall be
free, but it is right to tell them that their freedom
will be a trial for them and many of them
will fail. This is what you think."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Da's sholy de efficaciousness."</p>

<p>"You will promise, then, in order to help this
forward, to do what I tell you, and in secret,
so that no one here shall know. It is a small
thing, but a help to the cause of the Union
armies, which is the cause of the nation and
the negro&mdash;you will do this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah," in a trembling and awed whisper.</p>

<p>"The promise is upon your conscience as a
preacher of the Word."</p>

<p>"Yes, sah," almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>"This is it, then. You will give me the
clothes you are wearing, for which I will pay
you twenty dollars, and one of the horses hidden
in the hill pasture."</p>

<p>"Fo' God!"</p>

<p>"You will take my horse in exchange, ride
to-morrow morning, before daybreak, for Leesburg,
and take the train to Washington. Have
you ever been in Washington?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah."</p>

<p>"I will give you a paper which you will show
to any soldier about Washington who stops
you, and he will let you pass. In the city you
will find the War Department, and there leave
that paper and another I will give you. The
second paper you will not let any one see before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
you leave it at the War Department. You will
there be given forty dollars. When you return
you will come at night and take the horse
up to the hill pasture. Will you have to account
for your absence?"</p>

<p>"Miss Meely done lef' me go preachin' round
de cyounty, sah. Miss Meely"&mdash;hesitating&mdash;"Miss
Meely te'ible sot down on de Yankees,
sah."</p>

<p>"Be careful, then. We must work in our
garden."</p>

<p>"Sholy."</p>

<p>"And you see that this is your duty."</p>

<p>"Yes, sah."</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning, before daybreak, in the
road beyond your church, we will separate,
and you will not see me any more."</p>

<p>Beside Daddy Joe's bowed-down humility
and belief Gard had a sensation that in a
measure was new&mdash;a sense of ignobleness and
triviality. In some strange way there seemed
to rise out of Daddy Joe a certain spiritual
stature and significance. One seemed to discern
that nowhere in his soul did he play a
part, or play at anything, or remember himself.
He took Gard to be perhaps, a half-divine evangelist.
In Daddy Joe's primitive faith, Gard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
fancied, heavenly incarnated messengers came
as easily among men as his ancestral gods
had come in the jungle; spirits, evil or good,
still rode the night wind; a magical influence
of benefit or harm was a quality of things, like
their color and touch.</p>

<p>It was out of these conditions that the historic
faiths had come, with their deep simplicities.
The torch-bearers, with fresh fire, men who
travailed with the secrets of the future, had so
sat in doorways, taught such as Daddy Joe
the master words, and forgot the times filled
with wars and policies, while the sunlight was
on the grainfields, some brown creek quiet in its
bed, and the hearth smoke hanging in the air.
But he had not any such message for Daddy
Joe, and felt trivial in his mask. Wars and
policies, too, were trivial, shadows drifting
across the cornfields, ripples on the slow mass
of the creek. It was what occurred to men
in doorways and by roadsides that was of importance,
that lit the torches and determined
the massed current.</p>

<p>In the dark of the dawn they separated at the
highway. Daddy Joe rode downward on Gard's
horse with the white forefoot. A few hundred
feet and he pulled up, turned in his saddle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
looked back. The horse and man going up
under the pine avenue seemed to loom large
and vague in the gloom.</p>

<p>"Fo' God," he whispered, "ain' gwine see
him no mo'."</p>

<p>In the broad daylight on top of the gap
Gard examined his clothes, rubbed the smoothness
of his shaven face, and observed that the
horse he rode was an iron-gray. The clothes
were a gray felt hat, a long, black coat, thread-bare
and lined with silk, a white vest, dotted
necktie and unstarched linen, black trousers, and
his own shoes. He thought he might resemble
a seedy Southern gentleman in possession of a
whiskey flask and an eccentric plan for the
capture of the city of Washington. He might
imagine a resemblance in spirit to Jack Mavering.
It would furnish a basis and a sequence.</p>

<p>He came to the burned bridge on the Shenandoah.
Three or four horsemen were on the
other side who met and greeted him when he
had crossed.</p>

<p>"Howdy."</p>

<p>"Howdy."</p>

<p>Gard wrung the water from his wet clothes
and waited. One of the horsemen drew a
paper from his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Haven't seen a man like this anywhere,
have you?" and read from the paper.</p>

<p>"'Loose, black clothes, broad, stiff-brimmed
hat, shaven lips, black beard, smooth hair, of
sect called Dunkers, carrying saddle-bags, riding
bay horse with white forefoot.'"</p>

<p>Gard considered.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't gamble on the fo' foot," he said,
slowly, "but there was an individual resembling
otherwise that lucid and cyarefully boiled
description over 'yond the ridge. He gave
me a printed little damn sheet which contained
discourteous ref'ences to hell-fire. But"&mdash;thoughtfully&mdash;"that
ho'se, 'pears to me his feet
matched."</p>

<p>"Never mind. That's the man. They said
he went over the ridge. Where'd he go from
then?"</p>

<p>"He 'peared to be pointed for Harper's
Ferry."</p>

<p>"Well, we've lost him, then."</p>

<p>Gard looked sympathetic and reached down
into the tails of his coat.</p>

<p>"There's only one thing, seh, that's equally
good for disappointment and wet feet. This
heah whiskey never paid any duty to the United
States&mdash;I have my doubts, seh, whether it paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
any to the Confed'acy. I should like to devote
a generous percentage to the use of the Confed'acy.
You wouldn't mind assuming charge
of that percentage?"</p>

<p>A moment later the other asked, "Have you
got the tract that Yankee scout gave you?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The Dunker."</p>

<p>"Oh! ve'y good! As applied to me, I took
the ref'ences to be discourteous. I gave it,
seh, to a niggeh."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XVII" id="Chapter_XVII">Chapter XVII</a>
<br /><br />
<small>On the Question of the Exact Location of the Divinity
which is Ultimately Called Worth While</small></h2>

<p>There is said to be a divinity in our discontent,
the pull of some large law and onward
gravitation such as tends to make vivid rivers,
and only where it fails to influence are stagnant
pools. On stagnant pools the water-lilies
float, no doubt, white and passionate in fragrance,
and cardinal flowers are along their
shores; but law and divinity seem to be with
the rivers&mdash;such rivers as the Shenandoah,
which Gard met at different points, and often
enough during October, until it had become a
familiar sight&mdash;until the leaves of the oaks
had turned a burnished red-and-bronze, and the
Confederate army had moved far up the valley.
He passed through the army, around it, and
back again, explained his scheme for the capture
of Washington, collected orders for the
delivery of unlicensed whiskey, and walked in
the shadow of his discontent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>In answer to the question, "What am I in
my being, my centre and self?" that centre and
self seemed to grow featureless to his questioning.
The continual acting of a part suggested
the question&mdash;his being able to assume a character,
to fill it out, to mould himself to it, and so to
act it consistently and hardly with conscious
effort, emphasized the question. Had he no
shape of his own to protest against the presumption
of other shapes? Was a man no
more in reality than a piece of lead pipe for
ideas, impressions, and emotions of unknown
origin to run through for the mere purpose of
passage, and finally to wear thin and wear out?
Not altogether, since each experience seemed
to leave him not what he was before. The
meeting with Daddy Joe and with the general
by the burning railroad had left persistent
memories. These two at least seemed to him
to have centre, character, and anchorage.
They stood out in distinction. They had
shape and color and definition, and a certain
inner stature. Together with this distinctness
and stature there had been noticeable in both a
singular absorption in something not themselves.
The general had seemed to think there
was more point in his work than in himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
at least to turn to his work as if he thought it
best to act on that belief&mdash;Daddy Joe to have
given up his soul to wonder and awe of his
visitor. The text of one of the tracts he had
given to Daddy Joe had been, "He that loseth
himself shall find himself," and he remembered
noticing Daddy Joe's wonder and troubled
look, and thinking him badly lost. It was a
cryptic kind of saying&mdash;"He that loseth himself
shall find himself."</p>

<p>This business by the Shenandoah, this close
fingering of peril and card-play between life
and death, both parties being sharpers, ought
properly to be absorbing and exciting. To
attain distinctness, how could one be better elsewhere
than in the valley of the Shenandoah,
in an isolation so complete from all whom he
met from day to day, hostile in purpose to them
all, a single eddy against a wide current? Yet,
when he looked within himself he seemed to see
a space merely where forms flitted through and
singing gusts of wind passed, but none found
a home. The general at his work for a cause
that was a doomed anachronism was something.
Daddy Joe, in adoration of his hollow
demi-god and shamming evangelist, was something.
"Who or what am I? Is there any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
truth or any lie that from the bottom of me I
believe, any goal I hope for, any man or woman
I cling to?" One pictured the individual to be
a kind of self-fed fire. One denied conventions
of the mind and claimed his issue to be his
own, his solitary pilgrimage from one eternity
to another; he would look about him as he went
and take note, neither lose himself nor cloud
his eye nor cumber his feet, for the time would
be short, and there would be much to see. Now,
what he was doing and had done was nothing,
for he did not care about it; and what he had
felt and thought was little, only those flitting
forms and gusts of wind that made a stir in
their passage and left echoes behind them&mdash;some
sandy sediment, perhaps&mdash;some changes
in the mould or shell.</p>

<p>If men, failing to find the infinite and the
spirit outside of themselves&mdash;anywhere above
or beneath or around&mdash;concluded it must be
within, there lay the logic of their introspection.
How, then, if in the centre of that "within"
were found only an echoing space? At the
touch of this discovery would not all structured
dreams fall suddenly to dust and ashes, all
illumined purposes lose their flush? "Be yourself,"
cried the latest seers, rising from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
discouragement of faiths faded into myths,
an ancient sun frightened from the eastern
skies by their questioning. "Maintain your
poise, look within, for there hides divinity in
that holy of holies of a man of which his body
is the temple. A pilgrim you are, from the
darkness behind to the mystery before, and the
universe is a road for your travelling soul."
"Be myself! Who or what am I? The holy of
holies appears empty, and no altar is there,
either, nor self-fed fire." Was the universe
so mad a joke as to be a road merely for the
travelling of such bubbles, blown spherically
with tainted air, colored with solar fantasies,
apt to dissolve suddenly to a drop of soapy
moisture in the dust by some such accident
as was probable enough in the valley of the
Shenandoah?</p>

<p>The epochs in life, then, were not its physical
events, but crises in thought, some sudden or
gradual conviction or disillusioning. Gard
felt now that this had come upon him gradually,
beginning from the Peninsular campaign.</p>

<p>No doubt, whatever one thought was the
dwelling-place of divinity, or whatever he
called the one thing worth while, if it presently
appeared not to be there, there was always a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
marvellous emptiness in its place, a world
apparently convicted of barrenness, since its
growths were convicted of illusion&mdash;a point in
experience once called "the Everlasting No,"
a period of fretful discontent. It did not seem
probable that the lost law and divinity were at
sanctuary in that discontent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the valley of the Shenandoah
the oak foliage kindled and smouldered in dull
red, as if its approaching death were a matter
of pride and stately celebration, and Gard led
a singular dual existence, one side of which
seemed to be a staring at a topless and bottomless
distaste, and the other to be an argument
that good whiskey was cheaply and secretly
distilled in certain portions of western Virginia,
to the discomfiture of the United States&mdash;that,
if the Confederate army would purchase and
absorb enough of it, the capture of Washington
would become immediately probable.</p>

<p>The behavior, the schemes, inventions and
discourses of this secondary personage of his
creating had an objective interest. It seemed
to Gard to be in its way a noteworthy character,
judged as a piece of creative fiction.</p>

<p>It was modelled on Mavering, but gathered
details from day to day and perfected its sym<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>metry.
It appeared to have volition, a speech
and individual oddities all its own, which he
was hardly aware of having invented.</p>

<p>Some days after his return he came by the
Opequan and the place where he had fallen
headlong in the road with the man of the bandage.
He turned his horse into the bushes.
The body lay still in its place. The "secondary
personage" commented aloud in character,
and to Gard's surprise.</p>

<p>"It appears you didn' furnish that cyarfully
boiled description."</p>

<p>He broke boughs and threw them over the
body, mounted again and rode on.</p>

<p>"That's the injustice of circumstance."</p>

<p>A few hundred yards beyond he met a detail
of soldiers, halted them, and said to the officer:</p>

<p>"Do you see that white birch?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very good. Theah's a co'pse of a day or
two no'th of it which I discove'd accident'ly
and threw over it a tributo'y leaf. It looked
to me," with an air of reminiscence and respect,
"like a gentleman that might have
known good whiskey in his time."</p>

<p>"I'll look at him. Reckon I know who you
are. Haven't captured Washington yet?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>The men around grinned.</p>

<p>"The difficulty, seh, with the management
of this campaign, is its impe'viousness to ideas.
Good-mo'ning, seh."</p>

<p>It was the first week in November when he
rode across the Long Bridge into Washington
and fastened his horse to a tree in front of the
War Department.</p>

<p>He sent in his name, and the summons came
promptly. He entered an inner office, and was
alone with a thick-set man with a grim mouth,
and beard falling half-way down his chest, who
rapidly turned the leaves of a book of entry.</p>

<p>"Captain Windham?" he said, and went on
turning the leaves.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I have received three despatches from you.
September 30th, by an old negro. Christian
name, Joe."</p>

<p>"Daddy Joe," murmured Gard.</p>

<p>"Not at all! Simply Joe."</p>

<p>"Oh! I thought it was Daddy," said Gard,
sadly.</p>

<p>"Joe&mdash;simply Joe. October 15th, by an
officer of General&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;'s brigade, on sick
leave; name, Burton. October 24th, by Army
Post. Harper's Ferry. Is that correct?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I'm the fourth. I'm dated November
7th."</p>

<p>"I am aware of the date," said the other,
sharply.</p>

<p>He seemed to suspect some frivolous irony
in his visitor, a lack of seriousness and respect,
a motion of humor repellent to the authoritative
and downright atmosphere of that office.
Then he glanced suddenly at the calendar and
frowned.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, sir. It is the 6th."</p>

<p>Gard dropped his eyes to his torn and weather-stained
old gray hat, and turned it slowly
around his finger.</p>

<p>"It comes from being so long down there,"
he said, regretfully. "I thought their calendar
was one day ahead of ours. They seemed to
get there about one day ahead."</p>

<p>The other glared at him through his spectacles,
then said, shortly:</p>

<p>"I will take your information."</p>

<p>After the questioning and writing were finished
he continued:</p>

<p>"I will forward this to the new commander-in-chief,
appointed yesterday, the 5th"&mdash;with
another glance at the calendar for security&mdash;"in
place of the late commander-in-chief, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>lieved,"
and looked up quickly as if expecting
to find some revenge or satisfaction in his
surprise. But Gard did not seem to be surprised
or interested. He looked at a vigorous clump
of hair at the top of the official's head, then
down at his old hat indifferently.</p>

<p>"I think that I should like a furlough."</p>

<p>The other was irritated, almost fierce.</p>

<p>"Send in your application and I will see that
it is granted. That's all. Good-day. Captain
Windham, it remains for me to say that you
have done very well&mdash;remarkably well&mdash;and
appear to be exhausted in proportion. I repeat,
you have done very well."</p>

<p>"I think"&mdash;Gard paused at the door&mdash;"I
think it was Daddy Joe."</p>

<p>"Good-day, sir!"</p>

<p>Gard went down the steps, and wondered at
his caring so little whether he had done well
or not. He did not know why he had wanted
to irritate that irritable but powerful official.
It had seemed at the time to have points of
interest. Probably if one cared about a military
career it would not be wise to irritate officials,
and, if one did not, it lacked interest.</p>

<p>"He thinks himself something, that one.
But"&mdash;untying his horse&mdash;"I suppose he is."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
And he rode down the great avenue, whistling.
"The Campbells are coming&mdash;trala!"</p>

<p>Hundreds of flags hung from windows and
waved over buildings. The white dome of the
capitol rose up in the distance against the sky.
A regimental band was playing a quickstep
somewhere near. Towards the river the trunk
of the half-built monument stood, purposing
in time to commemorate one thought to have
been something in his time.</p>

<p>"This sort of thing is no great success.
There must be something wrong with me.
I think I'll go to Italy. Rhymes! What, ho!
I will be a poet. Let the Campbells come, let
the Campbells go. It's a foolish tune." Why
so enthusiastic at bowling over one's inoffensive
brethren in mortality? That sounded
like Jack Mavering, another homeless adventurer
and piece of fragmentary pottery, who
did not care, either, about the commander of
the Army of the Potomac, and might be taking
lunch now in that restaurant with the gilt
sign, the resort of correspondents and small
officers. Italy! The <i>Citronen bl√ºhen</i> there,
and one was either a monk or an artist, or in
love with an almond-eyed shepherdess&mdash;was
something with a denomination, at least, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
an ideal for a perquisite. He would go and
tell Helen and Mrs. Mavering. Helen would
dislike his not caring, and say so, in fact, with
vigor. He might omit it and enlarge on
Italy.</p>

<p>"I wonder what she'll say? I shouldn't
like it if she looked disappointed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XVIII" id="Chapter_XVIII">Chapter XVIII</a>
<br /><br />
<small>In which there is Discovered a Compunction</small></h2>

<p>The iron-gray horse&mdash;the former property
of one "Miss Meely," an existence in rumor,
suspected of being quick-tempered&mdash;turned
into an alley that led past the windows of the
restaurant with the gilt sign to a livery
stable.</p>

<p>The restaurant was full of the bustle of hurrying
waiters and the hum of conversation.
Mavering sat half-way down the line of tables,
the remains of his meal before him. He was
leaning back, looking peacefully at the ceiling,
when Gard came, sat down at the other side
of the table, and held out his hand. Mavering
took his eyes from the ceiling and said, mildly.
"Angel and ministers of grace! I prepared
an obituary for you a month ago." He drew
a thin, bony hand from his pocket and stretched
it across the table. Gard gave his order to
the waiter before he commented.</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! Why? If I remember the circumstances
correctly they were these."</p>

<p>Gard listened silently while Mavering told
the story with niceties of detail. Finally he
said:</p>

<p>"I don't see what Map did that for."</p>

<p>"Don't you? Then neither do I, but in the
highway of interpretation I should say he
doesn't like you to be alive&mdash;possibly has a
grudge."</p>

<p>"He must have, but I didn't know it before."</p>

<p>And later, when they were in the street that
climbed to the capitol, and seemed to come to
an end there, finally, in adoration of its sunlit
dome, Gard asked:</p>

<p>"Do you know where I'm going?"</p>

<p>"The question offers unlimited interest. I
take it to be rhetorical. I do not."</p>

<p>"I'm going to look for Mrs. Mavering and a
young lady who is with her. They're nursing
in one of the hospitals, or were last winter.
Did you know it?"</p>

<p>"I did not."</p>

<p>"Going with me?"</p>

<p>"I'll walk along and make up my mind."</p>

<p>After a few moments' silence:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was hard luck for Mrs. Mavering to
marry you."</p>

<p>"You speak truth."</p>

<p>"You didn't boil down to much."</p>

<p>"Blanked little. What's your intricate meaning?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of Map."</p>

<p>They did not find them till the next day.
There were ten or twelve hospitals in and about
the city, some of them in the suburbs and far
apart. Certain doctors knew the two nurses,
and one directed them to a hospital which turned
out to be a kind of military city with streets and
sentries; but they were not there. The hospitals
were all working smoothly at the time.
There had been no large battle since Antietam,
and there were few of those grim, dreary, and
confused scenes which at times made the hospitals
seem sterner battle-fields than any at
the front. Nevertheless Mavering felt and expressed
a sense of injury.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say I'm as tough as all
this!"</p>

<p>"I haven't said anything about your toughness.
Maybe you are. We'll try Mount Pleasant
now. That will be the last to-night."
And they rode away from the military city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know her," continued Mavering. "She
is what you would call, after duly considering
the adjective, select. She doesn't like realism,
raw humanity, and irregular event. She desires
humanity to be cooked and served in
courses, even to be ordered up to the rules of
art. By which figurative language I mean
to say that I don't see, that no ready interpretation
presents itself, that I'm interested to
know who persuaded her to take a ticket to
the suburbs of hell."</p>

<p>"You'll know if we find them."</p>

<p>"It was, then, this Miss?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bourn."</p>

<p>"Bourn. Exactly. Of that undiscovered
country. Having discovered who induced the
buying of the ticket aforesaid, there remains
how she did it, this Miss&mdash;a&mdash;Bourn."</p>

<p>Late the following day they came to a hospital
that had been a warehouse and stood on rising
ground, a little back from the river, where a
white steamer was lying at the wharf. There
were sheds around the building, and new wooden
steps built up to the door where the freight had
once been discharged.</p>

<p>A man at the door said Mrs. Mavering and
Miss Bourn were within, and took their names.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
Beyond him they saw accurately straight rows
of cots, each with a head at one end. In a few
moments he came back and said the two nurses
would be off duty in an hour.</p>

<p>They walked to and fro, past their horses
fastened in one of the sheds, till the dusk grew
around them. The hospital windows were
lit. Lights began to gleam beyond the river
and the flat lands. A mist rose and clung to
the water, crouched and ghostly. There was
no moon, but the stars were out, and one could
hear the lapping of the cold water among the
reeds. They did not see Rachel and Helen
come from the wide door down the new wooden
steps, or notice them till they were near, coming
hooded and cloaked through the dusk.</p>

<p>Mavering admitted to himself a personal and
direct surprise. His last memories of Rachel
were of tears, and then pale dignity and a
kind of fine repellence. But she did not betray
the past in manner. He could not see her face.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>"There will be scallops for supper, gentlemen,
and then may we have your adventures?"</p>

<p>Mavering found himself walking beside her,
and admitting his surprise to be personal and
direct. Presently he picked up his fluency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"I judge you would like to avoid reminiscence.
In the interests of clarity and calm
weather, however, allow me to say that I don't
intend to bother you; I'm a statue personifying
resignation."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jack. There is where we live.
Helen and I."</p>

<p>It was a brick house with a white door, two
slender pillars before the door, and low, pleasant
windows. It overlooked the river, on
which a gray layer of mist now brooded. Only
a few houses were near, and a grove of trees
lay beyond.</p>

<p>"We were in the city last winter and spring,
and in another hospital, till a doctor who had
charge sent us out here, in July, and found this
for us. Helen looked so badly. She sympathizes
so tremendously. She grew very thin
and white. They don't bring them here directly
from the fields, you know. Most of them
here are getting better. He said we would be
quite as much use. Do you know, it is very
nice to be of use."</p>

<p>"Do I gather that, apart from the charm of
utility&mdash;a thing that never appealed to me
by its own virtue&mdash;do I correctly infer that you
like it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Mavering opened the door. The lamp
in the hall shone across her face as she turned
with a curious smile.</p>

<p>"You don't change, do you?"</p>

<p>If Helen surprised Gard it was not with
change, but with that same vividness of her
personality; the tone of her voice, as definite
as a musical theme; the swift step; the
nameless something about her, impetuous,
challenging, demanding, that said, "This
is Helen&mdash;not a resemblance or recollection
merely, but one who cannot be made another."
He was surprised by the flood of his
recollections of her and by the fact that,
tested by the present, they were all found to
be true.</p>

<p>"Lady Rachel says there are scallops. It's
glorious of you to come. We know what you
did in the spring, and we have a piano, but you
ought to have an organ to tell about it, it's so
big. Is it fun to be a hero?"</p>

<p>"That's an odd idea. I thought you might
tell me who I am, or whether I'm something
at all; but I don't recognize that. Can't you
do any better?"</p>

<p>They followed Mavering and Rachel, and
came to the white door, that stood open for them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Helen looked up suddenly, but did not smile,
only said:</p>

<p>"You've changed, haven't you?"</p>

<p>Within he noticed Mrs. Mavering's touch
everywhere. Wherever she was, things about
her seemed to alter their practical bearing and
take on a difference. A plain table became luxurious
by virtue of something thrown across
it. A tall jar was placed on the painted mantel-piece,
and the mantel-piece itself became reminiscent.</p>

<p>After supper, where the scallops did not fail,
the four gathered before the grate. A fire
crackled, and the slender jar stood above, in reminder
of realms where form and color were
the only deities. Gard thought Mrs. Mavering
had changed. Helen's pallor and thinness
did not touch her imperative identity. Mrs.
Mavering had changed less in looks than in
tone. There was less languor and withdrawal.
As to the relations between her and Jack,
they did not seem to be uncomfortable at present,
and were no business of his.</p>

<p>"Helen tells me I'm changed," he said.
"Do you remember the night when I came to
see you instead of playing in Saint Mary's,
and Helen played she was a valiant knight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
and you were a lady hidden in a tower, and
I offered to be the ogre who was said to have a
tower of his own somewhere to be proud in?
It was nearly two years ago. I think the
knight is still charging, and wanting to make
wrong right by sticking a lance into it. But
the lady has come out of her tower and gone
questing with the knight, and doesn't seem
quite the same. And the ogre has found the
'somewhere' of his tower even more vague
than it was then, or, if he has found it, it seems
to be empty. Nothing lives there but winds
and ghosts now."</p>

<p>"What have you been doing?" asked Helen.
"We hear stories of other people, but we haven't
any to tell. But I don't understand what you
mean."</p>

<p>"What I've been doing hasn't much to do
with it. But I'll tell about that, if you like.
You'd better have Mavering's first."</p>

<p>"Singular anchorite!" Mavering murmured.
"Why?"</p>

<p>"You'll tell it better."</p>

<p>"Without doubt. But a reason for waiting
occurs to me."</p>

<p>"Don't you want to smoke?" asked Rachel,
suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not what I referred to, but it proves your
knowledge that my motives are physical and
uninspired."</p>

<p>In Gard's narrative there was no mention of
Map, and the discovery of the first disguise
was given to another source. It was told
simply, rather indifferently. When it was finished
Mavering remarked:</p>

<p>"The anchorite's style has the classical
merits of austerity."</p>

<p>It was part of Mavering's travelling-kit and
baggage of the nomad, this gift of his, to be
among tellers of stories, rare and excellent.
For soldiers around camp-fires, old women in
doorways, gentlemen at clubs and dinner-tables,
newsboys in the city, school-children
in the country with tin lunch-pails, farmer,
tramp, hod-carrier, doctor, clergyman, black-leg,
maiden in silk or gingham&mdash;it was all one;
they forgot themselves and country and kin
and present purpose till he was through. The
"Ancient Mariner's" spell was not peculiar
to that mariner. It is more ancient than he,
older than books, older than written language,
older than any city in pyramid or institution,
practised among hunters of wild beasts on
the site of Damascus, and among those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
first scratched the fat soil of the Mesopotamian
valley, the spell of the teller. His method is
anything convenient, a ballad chanted to a
harp, or a printed book. He speaks his mind
and says what seems good to him as he goes, for
the basis of it is the story, and the force is
the force of the man. Mavering practised the
primitive and personal method, and was heaven-born
to it.</p>

<p>His narrative ran from the beginning of the
summer, when he had come south as a correspondent
and joined the army in the Peninsula,
went on with easy gait and leaping of spaces,
gave glimpses and incidents by the way, dropped
out a month, fell upon the middle of September,
and drew to a close.</p>

<p>"Wherever I went that day over the hills,
behind the guns I saw that cornfield, or else
where the cornfield was underneath and not to
be seen itself on account of lying in the middle
of explosion, with wickedness and confusion
on one side, and sin and the reward thereof
on the other, all blackguarding each other
across it, so that it was covered with their
blasphemous breath; till I had a superstition
about that cornfield, and said, 'If corn could
be gathered therefrom, and corn whiskey made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
thereof, it would be a chemical anarchy of the
choicest, a combative distillation unexcelled,
a superior brand of whiskey.' It was dusk
when I came to the cornfield at last, and the
battle had gone to sleep in its cradle. The
stretcher-men were in the corn, and they told
me to ride around the edge where the mess
wasn't so thick. Their idea seemed to be good.
So that I never went into that cornfield, though
it was probably different from all the other
cornfields, but came around into a road beyond
it. There were men burning rails for camp-fires,
and the woods were black, and the anchorite
was strolling along, looking up at the young
moon, same way he always did."</p>

<p>Mavering paused a moment and puffed his
cigar, took it out and looked at it, and deepened
his deep voice. "I search in vain among the
sere and yellow leaves of memory, whether it
was ever in me to suck the end of a moonbeam
in place of a cigar."</p>

<p>He appealed to Rachel, who answered cheerfully
and surprised him again:</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it was, and so it must be
still."</p>

<p>"He's a hollow fraud, you know," Gard
said. "He sucks moonbeams through his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
cigar, and puffs them out of his mouth." And
Helen gasped.</p>

<p>"It's tremendous!"</p>

<p>But it seemed to her, putting together the
two narratives, that she might make a parable.
For in Mavering's story she seemed to see
colored lights flashed skilfully on a stage
with curious effect, a search-light swinging its
glare so that one scene after another leaped
out of the dark and vanished again, a pleasure
taken in the mere shift and play, the change
and tumult. The narrator walked in the
midst, approving of the noise, patronizing heroism
and sudden death, admiring the scenic
effect of the fire that splashed and scattered
around him. It was all color and sound, and
no real interpretation beneath. It meant nothing
in the end. In Gard's story, though the
tumult was great and the dangers greater,
the scenes painted clearly though more coldly,
and with fewer details; yet he seemed not to
care about them so, but to be looking wistfully
beyond for an interpretation and not able to
find it&mdash;not sure that there was one; fancying
there must be, somewhere, something to make
it worth while.</p>

<p>She sat in her old place at Mrs. Mavering's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
feet and turned the matter over, and thought
it strange.</p>

<p>It surprised Gard, in watching her, that he
remembered so much, so many little shining
points of detail about her&mdash;as she had looked
in the house, under the apse of Saint Mary's,
sitting so, in a white dress, a blue ribbon at her
throat, and the firelight shining on her yellow
hair. And Mrs. Mavering used to wear dark-red
dresses always, and suggest tragedy without
being aware of it. They both wore black
now, and starched, white aprons. Mrs. Mavering,
in some inward way, seemed more cheerful,
more like one gifted with health and humorous
philosophy. She was astonishingly beautiful.
Helen had grown white and thin. How delicate
and slim the hands looked that were clasped
around her knee! She used to have a sinewy
grip for a girl. Everything about her declared
personality. It always had, and still did.
Only, something or other seemed pathetic now.
Morgan Map was said to be engaged to her,
and would probably boil down badly. There
was pathos there. That vast primeval brute
had run his neck into a noose, by-the-way,
only it would not do to string him up if she
cared for him, though it might be a blessing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
to her in the long run. Mrs. Mavering might
have an opinion on that. What Map's grudge
may have been did not seem to Gard of any
great interest. He had had trouble with him
once about some commissary. Morgan had
looked murder, and uttered white-hot language,
and Gard had "corralled" the commissary.
The man must have a grisly disposition if that
were his "grudge."</p>

<p>Thinking of Map, then, his big, harsh-boned
face, mighty hands, massiveness, and "grisly
disposition," he glanced at Helen again, winced,
and started.</p>

<p>The shock went shivering through flesh and
bone. It hurt. He said, aloud, "Oh, that
won't do!"</p>

<p>He found himself on his feet, and the others
looking surprised.</p>

<p>The piano suggested an excuse, and he
sprang across the room.</p>

<p>"I haven't touched one in a year."</p>

<p>But his fingers trembled on the keys. He
had not seen his nerve shaken like that since
his first battle, which opened for him with a
shell bursting in a mud-bank. It plastered
him with mud, stood him on his head, and
shook his nerve admirably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>But this&mdash;Morgan Map&mdash;Helen&mdash;the pathos
of it&mdash;the hideous incongruity&mdash;the beast and
the pit and our Lady of Pity and Purity!
Oh, Madonna, over the altar of a little white-washed
chapel, at whose tender feet men poured
out daily the passion of their souls like water!
Years, years, so many years ago, and one
Gard Windham creeping into the empty chapel
at dawn, sobbing for the nameless heartache
and the groping loneliness, and Madonna was
over the altar, pale-faced, in silver-and-blue
robe, who whispered to his sobbing prayer.
"The organ! play!" Then he played and
forgot in the gray dawn, till the chapel was
full of presences, and the <i>bonus Deus</i> came
behind the altar and agreed with Our Lady
to be kind to Gard, and not let his sins frighten
him too badly. How he loved her then&mdash;Madonna!
<i>That</i> was Gard Windham! He was
real! What was he now? Swept down under
the years, the thinking and working, the flood
waves of the big world&mdash;and now&mdash;Morgan
Map! "I haven't prayed in long, Madonna,
but she's too slim and brave and yellow-haired,
and made from the beginning of her days to
be blessed and guarded from the slime and
stain, the red-eyed animal and the pitiless fist."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
It was worse&mdash;why, Mavering had points of
decency, and, besides, Mrs. Mavering was not&mdash;"I
haven't prayed, Madonna. I don't know
where you are. But call the <i>bonus Deus</i>,
for the beast climbs the stars. <i>Ora pro nobis</i>,
for Helen&mdash;for me. Or save the girl, and let
me go. It doesn't matter."</p>

<p>He felt that he had never played before like
that night. The piano seemed to tremble
under the fingers, to thud and flash, and the
old fire flooded his nerves.</p>

<p>He stumbled blindly on the way to the shed
where the horses were fastened.</p>

<p>"Do something for me, Jack. Tell Mrs.
Mavering about that Map business. Tell her
she must save that girl. It won't do."</p>

<p>"What in&mdash;what's your intricate meaning?"</p>

<p>"Map, man! He has a hold on her. You
see what he is."</p>

<p>"I do not. But I see&mdash;I begin to have a glimmer
as to&mdash;in fact, I take it you have an underhold,
anchorite. Go in and win."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," said Gard,
dully.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter. I am going to throw
my furlough and join the army."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>Mavering whistled, and then swore softly.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I'm no better than you are. What business
have you and I in heaven with our damned
private job politics? Haven't you learned that
yourself?"</p>

<p>They rode away towards the city, and separated
at a corner lit dimly by a street lamp.
Gard put his horse to a gallop and clattered
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XIX" id="Chapter_XIX">Chapter XIX</a>
<br /><br />
<small>In which Windham Drops Out of the Fight&mdash;and
Mavering Remarks on Human Adaptability</small></h2>

<p>There was a steep hill-side, and below it a
swift river, on the left the little village of Falmouth
huddled in a gully, and beyond the
village a higher hill, with a white house on
the crest. Across the river, and farther down,
the town of Fredericksburg was on fire in places,
ruins here and there smoking lazily. From
the town it was half a mile of meadow-land,
hollowed and hillocked but flat in its main result,
to the line of low hills, where the smoke
rested thick and white, and the artillery did
not rest at all, but growled and yelled unpacified.
Certain regiments had watched since
noon from this hill, seen column after column
go over the dipping meadows, and sometimes
a half, sometimes a third, come back. About
four they marched down through the huddled
village, crossed on a pontoon bridge into Fredericksburg,
and drew up beyond the town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
The shells shrieked over them. One exploded
against a little wooden shanty, scattering
splinters and dust. Two or three men dropped.
One of them sat up at Gard's feet and rubbed
his face.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm scared."</p>

<p>"That's nothing."</p>

<p>"No, that's nothing."</p>

<p>The little cabin took fire. The flames crept
up the dry, worm-eaten boards. The men
turned and watched them.</p>

<p>A young lieutenant, who was small, and had
a round, jolly face, came and walked beside
Gard.</p>

<p>"You see, those other fellows seemed to
lose about two-thirds; so a fellow will be pretty
apt to go in and stay there. About two to
one."</p>

<p>"About that. But the old man might mean
somebody to go in and stay there alive. He
might have that idea. Yours isn't inspiring."</p>

<p>"Oh, I only meant&mdash;I was thinking you
might let my people know if I'm potted."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"I'll do the same if&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>"No matter, Billy. I haven't any. Look
out for your end men. They're nervous."</p>

<p>In a few moments the column was gone,
scurrying away over hollows and flat stretches.
Gard lay on his face near the stone foundations
and smoking ashes of a barn in a field. "Out
of this fight," he thought, and turned over.
His muscles seemed to have all become dissolved
and loose. He lifted the edge of his coat and
looked under. "It looks like a bad one."
The blood did not flow steadily, but leaped and
was bright red. "It ought to be picked up.
It is an artery. If I knew how I might pick
it up!" It was a slanting trench, indefinitely
deep, and pumping up blood from the bottom.
There must be smashed bone in it somewhere.
You could tell from the slant the direction of
the point where the shell had burst. Two
other men lay near by, one of them still living,
but with the top of his head crushed; he was
kicking a hole in the ground with his heel.</p>

<p>"I might try."</p>

<p>He made an effort, and in a moment his hands
dropped back on the grass again, hands red,
wet, and feeble. The immense noise of the
cannonading became a hum in his ears and
then was silent. A little white cloud in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
sky seemed to spread over the blue and turn
gray. He closed his eyes.</p>

<p>It would be like this, after all. It had always
seemed a difficulty, a knotted problem that
speculation could not untie. It did not seem
like a knot or a difficulty now, but more like a
solution, a smoothing, a quiet explanation.
One thought life so difficult and death the
hardest knot in its logic, but if one found death
to be the answer instead of the worst difficulty,
looked upon in that way it might even seem
to be a simple answer. A gradual oblivion&mdash;not
exactly that&mdash;a blending of noises into
chords and glassy harmonies&mdash;it was more
like that.</p>

<p>The noises of the field were all gone, and
there was no more earth or sky, no men visible
running past with rifles, no roar, echo, concussion,
nor moan of the flying missiles. But
the silent vacancy was filling again with other
forms and sounds, whispering voices, faces that
leaned and smiled, others that threatened,
some that turned from him and cried out and
fled. One of those that fled was the Father
Superior. One of those that leaned and smiled
was Helen. But there did not appear any reason
for either, unless the Father Superior might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
be frightened at seeing what a lost soul looked
like face to face. Helen wore a broad, white
collar. Afterwards she came again with a
blue ribbon around her neck, dressed in white,
looking fragile, and said, "I'll fight for you;
I don't care who they are." Who were "they?"
Most of the forms were strangers, but Fritz
Moselle sat at a cloudy organ that pealed with
thunder and shot lightning from the top of
its precipice of pipes. And he played till the
yellow stars jumped down and sang anthems,
and Mavering came stalking after them, saying.
"They are an interesting and peculiar
people on that secular comet up there, and the
best liars I know; in the pursuit of which interest.
O Fritz, I'm going to pick up my kit
and go back." Mrs. Mavering would not
go, and Madonna said, "Be kind to Gard," to
the <i>bonus Deus</i>, who seemed puzzled. Helen
came and sobbed over him and stretched out
her hands. He caught at them, missed, and
fell several years through spaces and spaces.
Innumerable faces were plastered against the
sides of the pit, innumerable lips cried to him,
but he thought, "They all have issues of their
own." A great voice, heavy, stolid, and cold,
called, "Eternity around, divinity within,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
but no one really agreed with it. A gust of
wind drove down the pit and blew him like a
dried leaf, while he cried out helplessly, and
fled another year before the wind, till a slim
hand gripped his wrist and stopped him. The
grip was sinewy. The gusts and the stolid
voice went driving past them down the pit.
It was useless to count the faces plastered
against the sides. He could not raise his
hands; to raise his eyelids was a dragging
effort, sad and slow. It was night. The
air was damp and cold. They were carrying
him on a stretcher. Their steps sounded on
the pontoon bridge. The water rippled below,
or else it was the rain beating on the tent,
murmuring, murmuring. Helen was saying
"You <i>must</i> stay," and held his wrist, and he
said, "I never saw anything make up its mind
the way you do," so that they both laughed,
and the pit echoed like a bass drum which
made them laugh more, and then echoed with
infinite thrilling moans which frightened them.
And he whispered in the darkness, "It's fun
we're in the same pit," and she whispered
back, "Yes, gorgeous."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"It fills me with benignant admiration"&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
reads one of Mavering's articles, dated "This
21st of December, one mile, possibly two&mdash;Heaven
help us and call it three&mdash;from the Rappahannock,"
and entitled "Illustrated Speculations"&mdash;"It
fills me with benignant admiration,
this human adaptability. I have seen
to-day the troops returning from what they
called, with apparent justice, 'The Mud March,'
a futile procession, with no other result than
mud. For all night had the wind howled,
the rain smitten them compositely with sleet
and snow; they had splashed since dawn in
profound mud, and are now partially dried and
partially comfortable in ingenious ways, but
in the main still wearing mud, finding themselves
adaptable to mud, arguing that mud
adds a certain density to clothing, a casing
and protection to the features against the atmospheric
and social hostility of Virginia.
I have seen the author of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>
in a brigade hospital camp, holding the hand
of a bearded, piratical-looking stranger from
Michigan, who will die to-night and without
doubt adapt himself to whatever shall be his
lot. But this poet and tilter at conventions&mdash;what
convention he is tilting at now seems
obscure, what poetry he meditates with lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
of ungainly sprawl. I merely record that he
sits in a brigade hospital tent, holding the hand,
hour after hour, of one whom he knows not
from mythical Adam, proving himself, I infer,
in his own way adaptable. I have seen one
Captain Windham, of the 3d Regiment, &mdash;&mdash;, a
man known to me these half-dozen years, a
suggestive person with a problematical mind,
musician and scout, bred in a monastery, and
tending speculatively God knows where, but
likely, from his looks, to be presently disembodied
and 'blown with restless violence about
the pendent world,' a condition to which, I
believe profoundly, he will readily adapt himself.
He lies pumped empty of blood, and
with a shell wound more or less terrific, in the
tent where sits the author of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>.
The rain beats slowly on the tent. I see the
dim shining thereof, and of other tents around
it, lantern-lit. Under the high floor of a house-porch
I feed a fire surreptitiously with the
lattice-work, and look out into the night, and
consider the life of man, its beautiful inconsequence.
It is as good a place as any other,
this sub-portican retreat in the midnight pause
of bellowing war. It serves me and the time.
Have I not lived? Have I not slept in fine linen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
and stridden a horse, and looked into eyes that
smiled for me, and had a bullet hole through
my hat, and bowed from a platform to a sea of
faces? And were they any better, intrinsically,
than this? Why, then, my mud-encased and
mud-protected soldiery, my Michigan pirate,
my monastery-bred visionary and scholastic
adventurer, both of the latter now floating on
the edge of the downward-and-gone, my poet
of catalogues and statistics in defiant metre,
preacher of the gospel of muscular affection,
now practising that gospel&mdash;we are all, I conclude,
doing very well where we are. Human
adaptability! Or is it in some measure a
fluid type peculiar to this continent?</p>

<p>"Enters here one with shoulder-straps and an
ill-conditioned face, which he pokes in and inquires
curiously, 'Why I am burning up a
house full of patients?' In reply, 'If I were
burning up a house, without doubt there would
be reasons. But I distinguish, I am not burning
up a house, but lighting a torch of intelligence
for a public in the dark. Remarking,
'Oh! You're smoking up through the floor
of the porch. Look out!' he withdraws.</p>

<p>"Which reminds me to go up the river tomorrow
and find the end of a telegraph wire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
that is approachable and unabsorbed by the
military.</p>

<p>"A singular convocation of atoms is this
same war, wherein atomic egoism is at times
the more violently asserted, and again disturbed
and modified. The semi-translucent
but resisting barrier that separates the human
atom from the human atom is assaulted and
impinged against almost to penetration or
shattering. In this upheaval atoms tend back
to inorganic unity. The roots of existence
are exposed, the primeval reappears. Nevertheless
I have not seemed anywhere more
'an individual and an egoist,' to quote the problematical
musician, than now, sheltered here
from the sombre rain, burning another man's
green lattice-work for private comfort, and possessed
of an occurrent idea or desire, if it were
possible, to inquire of this Windham how fares
his individual egoism, and whether the adventure
apparently before him is, in his opinion,
one worthy of a sportsman.</p>

<p>"The scripture of the immortal bard mentions
a 'thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice.'
Imagination suggests an acclimatization of
the disembodied essence to Arctic needs, some
ingenious utilization of Northern Lights, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
confesses its suggestions feeble. My imagination
is not what it once was. Gray hairs of me
display their tenuous forewarning. 'The times
are waxing late.' Without pretending a polemical
interest in this war, I have candidly to
state that it looks to me like both engines in
the ditch. 'The jig,' in the stately words of
Job, 'is about up.' The rain echoes that
oracular opinion, and the brigade hospital
tents glimmer distantly, where lies that problematical
cross-breed of a monastery and later
conditions, where sits the author of <i>Leaves
of Grass</i> hour after hour, holding the hand of
a piratical stranger from Michigan."</p>

<br /><br />
<small>Treats of Further Incidents in the House with the
White Door</small></h2>

<p>The mud on the suburban road sucked about
the feet of Mavering's horse. So he came
again at night to the hospital above the river
and to the brick house with the white door and
pillars. Another horse was fastened at the
gate. A fat, grinning negro woman opened
the door, and when he entered the room, Helen
started forward with an exclamation, a red
spot on each cheek that did not belong there;
Rachel smiled graciously and came towards
him in the manner of polished and experienced
hospitality; and the man who stood backed
against the chimney-piece, his shoulders covering
half of it and looking as massive as the
brickwork, was Morgan Map. He gathered his
yellow eyebrows at seeing Mavering, moved,
swayed an instant, then clicked his teeth and
waited stiffly with back set to the brickwork.</p>

<p>"Ah, captain!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>Morgan growled something indistinguishable.
Mavering's wide mouth had on its
widest smile, and in his soul was pleasure
and appreciation.</p>

<p>"We have here," he thought, "a tidy little
game."</p>

<p>He sat down and described the late battle,
and considered. Morgan finally took his hat.</p>

<p>"Are you going into the city, Mavering?"</p>

<p>"Don't wait for me. Oh! It occurs to me&mdash;that
paper you lost, containing, you recollect,
certain specifications, was captured and went
South." He had the thread of his fluency
in hand now. "The object for which it appeared
to have been drawn up was, as perhaps
you have heard"&mdash;a pause&mdash;"not entirely
attained, and I don't know that it may not
itself have been destroyed. Probably not.
At any rate, witnesses could be found down
there in time, affidavits and so on, as to what
it contained and the circumstances of its&mdash;its
loss, which contents and circumstances
and their purport are only known to you, to
me, and to the person to whom the specifications
referred. I propose, if you don't mind,
to make Mrs. Mavering a fourth."</p>

<p>"You'd better ride into the city with me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should be pleased to oblige you, but it's
not my funeral. I have my own obsequies in
process. Why make myself likely to become
a secondary corpse at another man's?"</p>

<p>"Then I'd like a few minutes' talk."</p>

<p>"Another time. My dear sir, why worry?
why be anxious? You can't do otherwise
than exactly as you may be requested."</p>

<p>"That means there must be a deal," said
Morgan, simply. "All right."</p>

<p>Mavering thought, "Blanked if I don't admire
him!" and said: "Not a deal&mdash;rather, I
imagine, a surrender to stated terms."</p>

<p>"Where are you staying?" Morgan asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind about me. I have that
singular dislike just mentioned to the r√¥le of
a secondary corpse. But let me suggest specifically
that you might come out here in the
course of your convenience and receive from
Mrs. Mavering what we will call, perhaps,
advice. My opinion is that it will be the&mdash;let
us say&mdash;advice which you'll have to follow;
but, of course, your own judgment, sagacity,
talents for strategic combination&mdash;believe me.
I have the highest admiration for them&mdash;will
be the best of guides."</p>

<p>Morgan said, "All right," quite simply, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Mavering again thought, "Blanked if I don't
admire him!" admiring him, perhaps personally,
at least dramatically, out of his own fund of
appreciation for things that were fit and consistent.
The massive simplicity of Morgan,
the primitive unscrupulousness, the bulk and
unity of desire in him, the shape and size and
weight of bone, all seemed to fit together. He
was not problematical&mdash;at least, not divided&mdash;not,
in latter-day terms, "differentiated"&mdash;within
himself. "I suppose I know what Mrs. Mavering
would say. She needn't bother," Morgan
continued, and stooped and kissed Helen,
who seemed to droop under his touch. Mavering
admired him without interruption. "A
pyramid, an Assyrian bas-relief, a stately
savage unsophisticated by altruism and the
Ten Commandments. I'd give something to
know what he is going to do. What <i>can</i> he do?"
He thought he would take any reasonable
odds that Helen loved this one rather than the
problematical anchorite, and would not give
him up. In that case what would Rachel do?
The anchorite might be gone on his disembodied
adventure by this time, neither capable
of nor interested in doing anything mundane.
But when Morgan was gone, and Helen, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
up suddenly, asked, "Have you seen Gard?"
the progress of his speculation turned with
abrupt angle.</p>

<p>"Good God! I apologize! I've seen him since
the battle, Miss Bourn, but had no conversation."</p>

<p>Helen was silent, and Rachel said:</p>

<p>"But you and Captain Map were very mysterious."</p>

<p>"True, without doubt it seemed so." He
paused, studied the ceiling a moment, and
continued: "Map allowed a paper to fall into
the hands of the enemy, which accidentally
did no harm, but in which unscrupulous and
self-seeking parties might find opportunity to
make him trouble. I should not say that he
was at fault on a point of carelessness. In
fact, the plan, in a way, was admirable. I observe
that the night is brilliant and picturesque.
If Mrs. Mavering will walk out with me, whereever
the ground is not intolerably sloppy, I
will leave with her a hint which she may deliver
to Map, if he calls for it, and may indicate
the substance of it to Miss Bourn, if she sees
fit."</p>

<p>Rachel put her cloak on and the two went
out, leaving Helen before the fire. She leaned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
her head on one hand so that her fingers were
pushed into her hair; the other hung over the
arm of the chair, and looked slight, listless, and
pathetic.</p>

<p>The white steamer lay at the wharf, almost
ready for departure. Mavering broke the silence.</p>

<p>"I endeavor earnestly to become interested
in another man's obsequies. I fail. Do I go
back to the city to-night, Rachel, a pariah,
settled in my caste? The question has more to
me than an academic interest. If I go, it will
be something in the mood to find satisfaction
in meeting and doing vicious gun practice
with Morgan Map, who is presumed to be
waiting in a solitary place a quarter of a mile
down the road. Possibly he is not. I don't
know what his game will be."</p>

<p>Rachel had shrunk back when he began, and
now stood still.</p>

<p>"You promised me&mdash;you said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very likely; the promise is broken."</p>

<p>A board fence was beside the road; she clung
to it and shivered with the old, half-forgotten
terror.</p>

<p>"There was something else you were to tell
me," she said at last. He told her briefly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
incident of the dropped paper, and concluded:
"It's no concern of mine, or yours, unless you're
interested in this girl, who appears to be the
singularly efficient motive, of the state of whose
affections I am not informed. One of the last
things that Windham said to me was to tell
you about it and tell you to save the girl, meaning,
I take it, with more precision of phrase,
that you are to shunt Map into the ditch, which
you evidently can do if you want to. No
doubt, it will be my matrimonial duty to help,
though the ethical side of matrimony you
wouldn't expect to appeal to me. No more it
does. Is there any side that appeals to you?
What are you afraid of?"&mdash;with sudden savageness&mdash;"of
me? Keep your disgust to yourself,
then, till I'm gone. I'll get Map strung up
if you like, or shot, or blotted out by persuasion.
Windham's probably dead, and doesn't
care. Map's a damned scoundrel like me, and
a deal more concentrated. As for&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rachel caught his arm and stared up at
him:</p>

<p>"Gard! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>And Mavering laughed.</p>

<p>"Gard, is it? This little melodrama is well
done. Exit John Mavering into the jaws of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
hell. What comes next? My pearl of a wife,
my gentle and frightened dove, <i>will</i> you kindly
state what you are up to?"</p>

<p>"It's Helen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Helen! Helen, avaunt! I'm done."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, it all depends on him! Don't
you see?"</p>

<p>"I see you care much for Windham, and
perhaps yon girl with the yellow hair, and
have a sensitive dislike for me. Gods! she's
pretty, yon girl, but she ought to be fatter.
I don't know whether Windham's dead or
not, but he looked like a consumptive plaster-cast
when I saw him&mdash;been ploughed and
harrowed by a shell and made ready to be
planted for immortality, I inferred, but didn't
inquire. What do I care for him or the said
girl who is pretty but should be fatter? What
do I care for you? I don't know. But if you
propose matrimony for the two, I'll go so far
in friendship as to tell him he'd much better
be planted. Am I such slime to your cultured
taste? Say so, then, and, by God! you've seen
the last of me."</p>

<p>Rachel recovered herself. She still held
his arm. She pressed nearer and was silent
a moment. The steamer below the bank was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
brightly lit, the docks bustling and noisy. "You
needn't go. Come and help me, and ask what
you like. I think you love me a little. Perhaps
I was wrong in the beginning."</p>

<p>They went back towards the house. Mavering
admitted a degree of bewilderment. When
Rachel was in a state of self-possession, it was
difficult not to feel inferior. There were times&mdash;moments
of weakness&mdash;when Mavering confessed
a sensation towards her, never elsewhere
directed, and which might be called
respect&mdash;a hesitation, a summons somehow to
draw back the great muddy river of event as
well as the confluent stream of his own imperturbable
comment, to turn them aside from
pouring over her. It must have cost time and
selection to make Rachel, and the Mississippi
lacked discrimination.</p>

<p>Helen sat as before, listlessly. Rachel knelt
beside her and whispered. Helen started; the
listless hand gripped the arm of the chair with
a vigor that tore the cushion. She broke from
Rachel's arms.</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Gods!" murmured Mavering, in deprecation.
"This race of women! About six miles
back of the Creek landing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"The steamer goes out at ten. Pack a
basket, Rachel."</p>

<p>Helen left the room with a rush. Mavering
looked after her with wakened interest. "Who
and what is this?" Rachel came to him and
pleaded.</p>

<p>"I owe her everything. You left me so
desperate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I left you? I seem to have forgotten that."</p>

<p>"I thought there was nothing more for me.
She brought me to life again. Help her, Jack.
I think we can neither of us change. I think
it will be the old story again. But I'll try."</p>

<p>Mavering looked down and felt a touch of
compunction curious to himself.</p>

<p>"I suppose the anchorite was correct&mdash;problematical,
but accurate. I don't carry your price.
You're too expensive for me. As to the anchorite.
I'll find him and bring him back, dead or alive.
That's cheap, but the rest of it is expensive."</p>

<p>A half hour later the white steamer was
ploughing down the river. Mavering, in the
long, nearly empty cabin, stretched himself
on a sofa, denounced the execrable taste of
steamboat furnishing, and went philosophically
to sleep. Helen, on the upper deck, stared at
the starlit Virginia shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XXI" id="Chapter_XXI">Chapter XXI</a>
<br /><br />
<small>In Which We Go Down the River and Return</small></h2>

<p>A loud wind blew up the river, cold, sombre,
insistent. The river seemed to tremble in
waves and shiver in wrinkles under the monotonous
threatening of the wind, the stars to
be fretful in their bleak spaces. "Forever is a
long time." Helen wrapped her cloak more
closely.</p>

<p>"Dead!" The wind stated it coldly, insistently,
and did not mind how fiercely she
denied it. It was only the surface of the river
that trembled and glimmered so. The inevitable
reality was the current below&mdash;dark,
steady, and leading downward to that sea from
which the cold wind came with insistent statement.
If men and women were incidents to
powers beneath and influences over them,
like the myriad tiny flickers born of coincidences
between the divinity of the stars and
the toil of the river; if one only carried for a
short time this little torch of courage in a night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
without horizon; and behind the surface of
things "their substance and third dimension,"
in Gard's phrase, stretched away into a ghostly
distance; yet it was inborn in Helen to carry
her torch high, to lay lance in rest and challenge
the ghostliest shadow in sight, to be herself
personal and definite, to accuse even abstractions
of personality, to make a vivid world
of nearby things and live vividly within it.</p>

<p>In that world, life had seemed mainly to
consist of purpose and achievement; but on
the wide river between the crouching shores
that night&mdash;with the wind calling continually.
"Dead, dead"&mdash;wishes, resolves, and actions
to follow them, how shrunken and chilled they
seemed, if one were only an accidental wrinkle
on the river, possibly a glimmer if a star happened
to look that way!</p>

<p>"It is not true!" She went in and saw
lamps swinging the length of the saloon,
where men were asleep on the sofas and the
floor.</p>

<p>The engines throbbed and the paddle-wheels
creaked and splashed near the window of her
state-room. She lay awake, and yet seemed
to hear sounds like a moaning organ, to see
Gard's face floating, white and motionless, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
black water, and moving down seaward with
a tide that she tried to block with her hands.
She started up, choking and sobbing, and
heard the engines throb, the paddle-wheel
creak and splash.</p>

<p>It was still dark when the steamer drew in to
a wharf. Lights were moving about. There
were three or four houses, a flag flapping sulkily
in the wind, a train of cars and a puffing
engine, a line of black bluffs against the sky.
It was misty dawn when the train started south,
and full sunrise when she stepped from the
train with Mavering and saw a house with
high porch on a hill; below, near a grove, the
brigade hospital tents. The big, hurrying
surgeon said: "Move him! Good God!&mdash;I
beg your pardon&mdash;yes. It's run mighty low.
It needs warming and coaxing. There's da&mdash;I
beg your pardon&mdash;there's very little of either
here. This is the first time in six weeks the
army of the Potomac has had any luck, to my
knowledge." He looked at Helen suddenly,
dropped his gallantry, and continued, gravely:
"As to the chances, since you ask me, I suspect
there are complications. But as an alternative
to nights as cold as this, I should say, do
almost anything." A moment's silence, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
he went on: "They lie around here, about five
hundred to an acre, several acres of them.
That's the trouble. However, I knew Captain
Windham. I admired him&mdash;this is the tent.
I hope you have everything you need. Give
him brandy and milk. The train goes back
about eight. Good-bye." The big surgeon
hurried away.</p>

<p>Mavering stepped in behind her, looked
around, and said: "Exactly. The pirate's
gone." Helen did not hear him. A pile of
straw and some blankets, a black cloak, the
white face against it, like one drowned and
going seaward with a tide. She dropped on
her knees and bent over it. "Will you get the
things," she half whispered, looking around&mdash;"a
stretcher and some men? Please take my
purse and come back in time for the train."</p>

<p>Mavering went out. In the way of descriptive
adjectives he thought "fierce" was the
word. She looked "fierce." "And," he reflected.
"I dare say a man may turn out a domestic
cat if he were half drowned and properly
stroked and not too old. <i>Quien sabe?</i> If the
anchorite comes to, I'm gambling my gray
hairs he's tamed. Gray hairs are distinctly
a misfortune."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>Helen leaned close over. The "must" and
"shall" that absorbed her seemed straining
at her eyes and lips. She felt as if she were
lifting a weight. "You <i>must</i>, Gard, you <i>must</i>
stay"&mdash;struggling to keep the white face
from going down in the suck of an undertow,
drawn under by some blind power that knew
no measures of values or who loved and remembered
and who forgot.</p>

<p>Measure of values! Your bullet goes forth
in a pointed manner, appears to be determined,
purposeful, greatly in earnest, and buries itself
in a sand-bank, or the brain of a scholar&mdash;all
one to the bullet, all one to the rifleman who
knows nothing of the matter, all one to the
per cent. of averages, to the flowing laws and
far-off events of the universe.</p>

<p>"But you <i>must</i>, Gard, you <i>must</i> stay." So
tiny a torch to shake with such insistence at
the wide night and call on its hurrying storms
to stop! Enter demurral and private petition
to those high courts and abstract legislatures!
"The constitution does not provide for you in
person."</p>

<p>"Then amend it. It should. It does me
wrong. What are laws for if not for justice?"</p>

<p>"They are not at the call of human justice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, then, not justice! But have pity, or
forget and go by! Only let me keep him. I
love him. I will not let him go."</p>

<p>The protest seems almost as persistent as
the law. After all, it might be itself a law or
an amendment in process of making, this protest.
But if Gard Windham should not go on
that adventure and exploration, inferred by
Mavering to be, perhaps, Arctic in character,
and should linger back to life in the course of
event and not by virtue of an amendment,
probably Helen would not care how it came
about.</p>

<p>She did not care how the men with the stretcher
looked, how they took off their caps or
whispered. The moving train and the steamboat
were vague things aside. Both were
crowded, but no one spoke to her. It seemed
to be arranged, recognized, and admitted.</p>

<p>A group gathered about Mavering on deck,
who said: "Why, it appears to me a situation
that doesn't admit of remark. It looks like a
case of stand off and clear the road. It has
that distinguished appearance." And there
was a murmur of assent.</p>

<p>The wounded, sitting or lying about on both
decks and in the cabin, were wretched and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
sinister sights. Some babbled in delirium;
a few, like Gard, were sunk in torpor, unconscious
of their issues. The steamer ploughed
through splashing and gurgling water. The
driven, wintry clouds streamed across the sky,
gray and ragged as battle-torn banners. Hawks
floated over the river, graceful in their savage
hunt over the double-decked steamer loaded
with human pain bound for the hospitals.
And Helen noticed and remembered nothing
of it. She seemed to herself more like a ghost
alone with Gard, who was another ghost.
Empty space was around them, the existence
of both so tenuous that it consisted only of the
faint pulse-beat in his wrist, which she held.
This beat was the measure of the flight of
time, and the slender thread that bound the
world together. It used to seem to her that
Gard was too intangible, almost unreal. One
could not say what he was like. What did he
mean by: "I don't care whether I'm an admirable
person or not; I'm a partially illuminated point,
floating along I don't know where or why.
What's the use of caring? There's too much
before and after?" Or: "Every one lives in a
dungeon; he doesn't know any other dungeon
than his own?" And when he used to play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the organ in Saint Mary's and fill the great
church with mystical voices, he had seemed to
her something not of the daily world, but of
a world partly like the one in which she built
her own fanciful castles; only it was wider
and more peculiar, and the powers in it were
strong and strange. However apart from
Gard himself her idea of him may have been,
it was one which this long watch beside him,
the touch of the slow pulse, and the knowledge
of how closely he now at least moved along the
frontier of shadows, only made more intimate.
The organ was not needed to interpret him.
She felt that she knew what he was like. She
thought the pulse-beat spoke, as the organ used
to speak, with the same swift, immediate presence,
and that, when she whispered "You
<i>must</i> stay," it throbbed an answer: "You
mean, come back. You've no idea how far
it is down here, and very curious. But maybe
I can, if you'll hold your end of whatever
it is." And so the crowd and the murmur, the
babbling in delirium of the man on the next
stretcher, the laboring of the steamer ploughing
up stream, the passing of hours, all seemed
moved apart from her. Sometimes the distant
consciousness would seem to almost or quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
return, and look out at her under wavering
eyelashes. The lips moved, and she fancied
they said, "I knew you were there." She became
aware, at the same time, that the steamer
had stopped, that the stretchers were being
carried out in procession, and that over her
stood Mavering, Rachel, and Thaddeus Bourn;
and of these she was hardly aware enough to
be surprised at Thaddeus. When they came
to the house with the white door, and he drew
her aside a moment, she half resisted in a
dazed way, and felt as if not to be close to Gard
were against nature and reason. Thaddeus
drew her into the sitting-room. The men had
carried Gard to the room beyond. They had
set down the stretcher and were moving him.</p>

<p>"In point of fact," began Thaddeus, "I've
come to take you home. Your mother is&mdash;a&mdash;not
so well. I fear it is quite serious. I wrote
you, but it did not at that time seem serious.
A woman of astonishing placidity, my dear,
which I have sometimes felt tempted to recommend,
in fact, to your imitation. But the
circumstances are such now that it would not.
I might say, be in good taste. Her condition
is, I regret to say&mdash;seems to be&mdash;but perhaps
to-morrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>He was not sure she heard him.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, to-morrow."</p>

<p>To-morrow might be what it liked if he would
let her go now. She slipped away. The men
came out and left the house. Rachel followed
with Mavering and closed the door. After a
time Thaddeus said:</p>

<p>"Relative to a certain estate, Mrs. Mavering,
in which you and I made investments, undertook
a trusteeship, has it not, in your opinion,
been administered somewhat&mdash;a&mdash;speculatively?
It appears to me to be loaded, I might
say, with liabilities. I do not see that the&mdash;a&mdash;securities
are ascertained."</p>

<p>"Oh! but I think he will get well."</p>

<p>"Granted&mdash;and then?"</p>

<p>"He <i>must</i> care for her."</p>

<p>"Granted&mdash;a&mdash;it would seem probable, and
then?"</p>

<p>He deliberately refrained from looking at
Mavering, who was examining Thaddeus, his
gold-rimmed glasses and accurate tailoring,
with speculative interest.</p>

<p>"I doubt whether you can argue from me,"
said Mavering, serenely. Rachel flushed and
Thaddeus protested.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not at all. It is admitted that the garb
of civil society has never fitted me. Any coat
will go on me, but none will fit to the satisfaction
of fashion. But as to the anchorite, I
would not argue a parallel. I suspect he will
cut his coat to newer fashions than mine&mdash;possibly
than yours. My dear sir, I'm an egoist
and you're an egoist."</p>

<p>"True," murmured Thaddeus, "a social
egoist."</p>

<p>Mavering stopped long enough to reflect
that he liked this Thaddeus Bourn, a man
apparently with conversations in him.</p>

<p>"Very good. And so it occurs to me in
passing that I may be the more elementary,
anterior type; and, say, Morgan Map, a still
further elementary, anterior, antediluvian&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excellent!" cried Thaddeus; "excellent
choice of phrase! My idea exactly! I said a
primary, primitive, primordial."</p>

<p>"Good words, all of them&mdash;descriptive and
discreet."</p>

<p>The two smiled at each other with appreciation.</p>

<p>"Map might do," continued Mavering, "if
he had all the room there was. He needs more
room, properly for his state of culture, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
than I do. Now the anchorite&mdash;I refer to
Captain Windham&mdash;is, if an egoist, possibly
a fourth kind; I am inclined to think&mdash;to question&mdash;whether
we might not argue him even
in advance in continuance of this theory, which.
I perceive you agree with me, is not without
interest."</p>

<p>"But," said Thaddeus, distinguishing, marking
precision with his eye-glass, held between
two fingers, "as regards, now, a definition."</p>

<p>"I leave it to your more discriminating
choice. I contribute this observation, however,
that when the anchorite wants more room he
is apt to climb into the air for it, instead of
quarrelling with his neighbors on the earth."</p>

<p>Mavering took his leave. Rachel went to
the window and stood looking after him. Thaddeus
polished his glasses, and thought that
Mavering was evidently a man with conversation
in him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XXII" id="Chapter_XXII">Chapter XXII</a>
<br /><br />
<small>Of Mavering, Who Disappears&mdash;Of the Gray Poet&mdash;Of
Morgan, Who Appears Once More</small></h2>

<p>When Gard returned to the knowledge of
the light, he brought with him the impression
that Helen was near. It was an irritating
shock not to find her. He remembered a number
of widely separated moments when he had
been conscious of physical things&mdash;unless all
these were vagrant dreams: the rain on the
tent, the surgeon, the bitter cold, and Helen
sitting there holding his wrist. The last was
a portrait without surroundings or background.
Her hair was pushed away from her forehead,
and her eyes had seemed to probe and search
for him down wherever he was lost.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mavering sat beside him now. She
shook her head to signify silence when he
wished to say something, to question her about
this doubt; so that he fell to staring at the
ceiling and trying to work his brain, How
slowly the ideas moved, how reluctant they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
were, how pale and unsuggestive! To remember
something was to pull a long, sagging rope,
until at last the remembrance would emerge
from a tideless, flat sea in a drowned condition.
It was exasperating of Helen not to be there.
The exasperation lasted four months.</p>

<p>The days and weeks slipped by, marked
less by nights and days than by bits of information
given and assimilated at intervals.
He learned where he was and how he came there,
and brooded over the subject, turned it slowly
in his mind, and concluded to go on turning
it. It had innumerable sides, surfaces, depths&mdash;some
that were astonishing, some that melted
into day dreams. It seemed to him that he
was on the way to recover in time&mdash;a doctor,
in fact, with side whiskers, gray and pendent,
came periodically, and stated as much in a
loud voice, and in that case he was glad that
life looked interesting and came towards him
with shining approach. The winter sunlight
falling through clear panes under white, translucent
curtains was as if newly washed.</p>

<p>It is said that the secret of the strong, temperate
zones lies in their winter and spring,
the antiseptic storms, the trance, and burial,
and then the cleansed revival, the issues of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
fresh seed-time. And there appear to be certain
bitter waters, flowing near the roots of existence,
in which, if it so happens to a man, he
may wash his eyes clear of confusion, and
afterwards wonder how it came that he was
once weary of living. So it seemed to Gard
that he had gone around a circle and begun
a new season of expectation. He was that
black-robed acolyte again, slim and somewhat
pale, who, in breathless eagerness to
see and know, had come out of the door of the
brotherhood's brick-walled court-yard into the
hurrying avenue, hearing the high fluting.
"Follow, follow," looking for a banner and
sword and shield, possibly for a girl in the
brakes with sunlight on her hair, at least for
something he had not tried to explain to the
Father Superior. Whatever his motives and
purposes then, they had become clouded since,
and were clear again, and calling, "It is
time to be alive and out among the melodies."
It was good&mdash;the mere living; a handsomely
furnished world, with a number of things
in it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mavering went away in the late winter.
Widow Bourn died in January, when wild
winds and snows were beating against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
combative little church, and Helen was alone
in the cottage, except for an elderly woman,
depressed and angular, in the kitchen. Helen
refused to go to Thaddeus, to his bewildered
disgust. Mrs. Mavering, for some reason,
did not think the refusal strange, but she became
intent for the North as soon as she
heard it.</p>

<p>"May I come, too, Lady Rachel? I mean
when this mossy-whiskered physician unties
me."</p>

<p>"May!" she said, scornfully. "You must.
Where else should you go?"</p>

<p>"It's queer, but it seems like home, Hagar.
I never saw it. Wasn't Hagar the mother
of homeless Ishmaelites?"</p>

<p>So Mrs. Mavering was gone. One Sabrina,
a fat negro woman, was left, who shook the
floor with her tread, who wore extraordinary
green kerchiefs on her head, and exploded in a
melting gobble of mirth at Gard's every remark,
till humor became a burden and he tried
depression. "I shall die, Sabrina." Sabrina
gobbled with joy. He tried wrath. "You're
a galoop, Sabrina, a galoop!"&mdash;and Sabrina
spilled his coffee over her billows of delight.</p>

<p>Mavering appeared and disappeared, brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
with him once a big, deep-breathing man,
slightly singular in dress, with a blown, gray
beard and hair, soft eyes, and affectionate, impulsive
ways. Mavering introduced him.</p>

<p>"He calls himself a poet, not a Plesiosaurus.
His poetry looks as if it were written, nevertheless,
by a saurian with one of his fins. I recommend
you two to mutual and plastic embraces."
Afterwards the gray man came often
of himself, and would sit by the bedside, holding
Gard's white, bony fingers, and recite:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">"Out of the cradle endlessly rocking&mdash;"</span>
<span class="i15" style="margin-top: -.5em">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="i4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span>
<span class="i15">"... do I not see my love fluttering out there among the breakers?</span>
<span class="i2">What is that little black thing I see there in the white?"</span>
</div></div>

<p>Or, "The Song of Myself"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">"A child said, 'What is the grass?' fetching it to me with full hands."</span>
</div></div>

<p>They grew suddenly friendly and confident,
and talked art and letters. "Some of that is
good stuff," Gard remarked, "and it's all
yeasty&mdash;something stirring in it. But I don't
see&mdash;Here, you're an egoist, too&mdash;you simply
whoop with it&mdash;and impartially affection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>ate
at the same time as a self-obliterated
Buddhist."</p>

<p>"They are one. The more I love myself,
the more I love you."</p>

<p>"But what do you mean by, 'If I worship
one thing more than another it shall be the
spread of my own body, translucent mould of
me'? Now, that's belated Greek."</p>

<p>"It's nothing old. It's new and democratic."</p>

<p>Gard grumbled feebly.</p>

<p>"It sounds queer enough for a gospel. It
won't do for me now. I shall have to fat up
to it."</p>

<p>The gray man leaned forward with that
tremulous, dewy look in his eyes. He seemed
to have an immense capacity of feeling, a
physique made large to endure it.</p>

<p>"You didn't love yourself enough. All
that wasn't love. You didn't love any one.
Love inward, love outward, love everywhere,
love some one most, love many much. All
empty without that, a drifting boat without
anchor. You look for the boatman. No one
there. Drowned? No. Never was there."</p>

<p>After a long silence&mdash;"Say that 'Cradle'
thing again. It's a man's soul in the body of
a whale. I don't believe it's new and demo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>cratic.
It must be old and human. But I
know what you mean."</p>

<p>So February and March were gone. Mavering
said there was a big fight coming, went
away, and came no more; nor the gray man,
either, who was absorbed in his hospitals and
his "average young man," and grown hollow-eyed
with watchings and strenuous sympathy.
Everything gone, nothing coming except spring
and letters from Hagar; nothing staying except
Gard himself and Sabrina, who reminded
one of melting butter, but of whom the quantity
grew no less. "Hagar! Hagar!" the high
fluting voice seemed now to call continually,
till the tension of his longing, Gard fancied,
would pull Hagar to him if he did not go soon.</p>

<p>Late in April they packed him into a night
train, and all night, or whenever he awoke
and looked out, the earth seemed to be running
away southward, as if sucked towards the
whirlpool of the war, but the stars to be travelling
northward with him. How impatient they
were! How they snapped and danced and
quivered! "Hurry, hurry! But you will see
how we will shine over Hagar and forget the
bleak laws of our journeyings, and be night-lamps
in Helen's garden."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning the train stood still in the
terminal. He had some hours to wait. He
crept through the station. The rattle and
roar of the city met him at the door. The
few returning soldiers like himself were lost
in pursuing crowds, the only signs here of
the war that to southward had seemed branded
on the soil and written across the street fronts.
A policeman caught sight of his uniform, and
added some points to his rank, out of benevolence.</p>

<p>"What'll you have, colonel?"</p>

<p>"I think I'll have a cab."</p>

<p>The hurrying crowd paused, and cheered
huskily when he drove away. He had the cab-man
drive across town and down the old avenue.
At the church of the Holy Trinity there was
a morning service beginning, and he climbed
the steps. Within, a few hundred people were
scattered about. The only sound was the
moaning of the organ. High up at one side
he could see Moselle's hunched shoulders and
dingy yellow head, faded with age, against
the blue and gilded pipes. Moselle began to
play a prelude, something stately and stern,
like the thousand-century-old front of a gray
crag, that might be well known but never could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
be familiar. The dingy old head moved Gard
more than the prelude. He went back to the
cab and drove down towards the Brotherhood.
There was no flowing river so strange as the
flowing river of the street. Every one was
isolated, no doubt; but, after all, there was a
bond. It ought to be celebrated and sworn to.
A truckman on top of a dray looked down and
probably caught him smiling to himself, grinned,
and shouted, "How goes it?" Here and
there on the sidewalk, too, men called out to
him. Every door and window here between
Trinity and the Brotherhood was familiar,
and the brick walls and shuttered windows of
the Brotherhood were eloquent. He thought.
"I'll go in another time, and see Francis and
his sick flower-bed, and the school and Andrew.
It would scare me into a relapse to see the
Superior now. Nobody but the <i>bonus Deus</i>
ever understood him, and the <i>bonus Deus</i> is
in Hagar."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So he went back to the station. The train
ran for an hour or more past glimpses of the
sea, and then turned up the Wyantenaug
Valley. At Hamilton he changed cars. The
brave old river sweeps around a curve, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
Hamilton lies in the curve. He could see the
tower of the grand-stand in the Fair grounds,
and Saint Mary's among the other steeples,
but he sat still on the station platform, saw
his trunk go by on a hand-truck, and watched
beyond the freight-yards the rippling, glinting
river, hurrying, busy, with its myriad little
shining points of happiness. Was it the languor
of his weariness or a magic in the river
that flowed down from that promised land of
Beulah, the mythical Hagar, the mother of
the homeless&mdash;a Mecca, a Bethlehem, an Arden
of wise flowers and musical brooks? The
river seemed to gesture, and mutter syllables
and sentences. Some one spoke loudly over
his head. He looked up and saw Morgan
Map.</p>

<p>"Going up the valley? So am I," Morgan
said, and Gard nodded languidly. It occurred
to him, slowly, that he ought to be surprised.
"The train's ready. Come along."</p>

<p>A practical man, this Map, Gard thought&mdash;a
very genius of accomplishment. Why should
he go into Beulah, too? Why not? But he
must be doing something here, this forcible
schemer, who did nothing unaccountably. If
he meditated violence, it was a poor place for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
it. Much better to have set fire to the house
near the hospital, or corrupted Sabrina and
poisoned the breakfast. Still&mdash;Gard pulled
himself slowly up the car steps. His knees
had not yet recovered from their wavering inadequacy&mdash;still,
it was what Mavering would
have called "a sportsmanlike situation." Map
might try some simple, antique, and desperate
thing. In that case it would be well to get
one's gun where it could be pulled suddenly.
Gunpowder was the handicap that made an
invalid even with two hundred pounds and
six-feet-two of red-haired, aggressive health.
And all that was nonsense. What a sinewy
force it was&mdash;this love of a woman!&mdash;that suddenly
snapped a man's habits apart, dragged
all his other motives indifferently after it; one
of the universal energies. Joy and desperation,
and the beast and the climbing soul, seemed
packed in it more closely side by side than in
any other experience.</p>

<p>Two or three men were in the car at one end.
Morgan went to the other end and pulled over
a seat. The two sat down facing each other,
and Morgan produced cigars.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you brought these, however you
happen to be here," said Gard. "The doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
forbids them, so I don't carry any, but accept
them from fate. It's a fine point of casuistry.
I disliked that doctor&mdash;I disliked his whiskers,
mostly. They used to get twisted up in my
feverish nightmares. <i>Did</i> you happen to be
here?"</p>

<p>"No. I found out what time you were going,
got leave of absence and came along."</p>

<p>"To see where I was going? I don't know
that I understand why."</p>

<p>"Oh, partly. I had a general plan. I'll explain.
I'm a practical man," he went on, quietly,
after a moment. "I don't believe in loading
up with the past. No scruples and no malice.
What's no use to remember I forget. They're
all dead weight. I cut loose. That's the way
I'm made. Now, I don't know how you're
made&mdash;don't know what kind you are."</p>

<p>"Neither do I. I'm going up to Hagar to
find out."</p>

<p>"Well! I said; I'm done, hedged out; hedged
in, too. The question is, Can I cut out&mdash;cut
loose? It depends on Windham. The more
I thought about it the more I didn't get any
definition of you. I concluded to come along&mdash;see
what could be done&mdash;clear up the ground&mdash;know
what's to pay. If you go to Hagar with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the purpose supposed, that's all right. I'm
done, anyway. I have an errand of my own
there&mdash;which doesn't concern you, however. I
throw up my hand. I was in hell and played
for keeps. I say now, a man that's won needn't
bear malice. No use in that. He can call
me what he chooses if it eases his mind. That
won't hurt me any, nor him. He's safe. He
needn't be dainty. It's a fact. I sent a tracer
after you up the Shenandoah. God knows
why it missed, I don't. I could have sworn
there was daylight through Jack Mavering's
head. Missed again. He walked in on me
in Mrs. Mavering's sitting-room and made
me feel like a wet hen. I put my head in my
pocket and walked out. What else could I
do? You're going to Hagar. All right, I'll
show you where to go. What more can I do?
I'm telling you all this now from policy."</p>

<p>"And I'm calling no names," Gard remarked.
"Mavering professes to have a great admiration
for you as a practical practitioner. You're
probably right to come along."</p>

<p>"Oh, I figure pretty well. I was a fool&mdash;but
still, that thing was figured pretty well. I'd
have won out finally all right if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I object to what you have in mind to
say&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>prefer
to think you wouldn't 'have won out
finally, if&mdash;' Better not speculate. We'll call
that a stipulation."</p>

<p>Map lifted his brows and settled himself
more comfortably. A change, an expression
of relief, slipped over his big, harsh-boned face,
the only sign of the tension that he had been
under.</p>

<p>"Stipulations&mdash;that's what I want. If there's
anything to be done to restore amiability, good
God! it's surely my part to do it."</p>

<p>Gard looked out of the window and was
silent.</p>

<p>Green meadows and brown fallows moving
past, white houses under aged maples, hills
of climbing pasture lands and pale-green
forests. Did men carry any sullen burdens in
this valley? Better drop them and go unburdened
into Hagar.</p>

<p>"I suppose there might be a sort of public
duty involved," he said, "which interests me
just now about to the extent of an empty medicine
bottle. I flung the last one at Mrs. Mavering's
black cook. You remember Sabrina?
You couldn't even break glass on her. Do
you think of taking up regularly with&mdash;I beg
your pardon&mdash;with a criminal career?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>"Criminal! A criminal's a fool. I'm no
fool, or never was before. I lost my head.
That's only once. Criminal! Why, look here!
What do you make out of this world you and
I have been shovelling dirt in now some years?
Isn't every man in it for himself and against
his neighbor, if his neighbor's in his way&mdash;which
he partly is, always? Do people go into
society to amuse themselves or each other?
Themselves, of course. And business is competition,
and competition's private war according
to rules of custom. I'm supposed to be a
lawyer. That's a succession of jobs at beating
somebody else and getting paid for it.
This civil war is one collection of private interests
against another collection. The South
was getting beaten in business&mdash;held a losing
hand&mdash;wanted to break up the game. That
meant a fight. Take you and me. You
wouldn't let me out of this if you saw anything
more in it. You don't see anything more in
it. I don't, either. I'd do exactly the same,
for the same reason. Never shove a man
farther than you need to make your point.
I don't compete with you any more in anything.
I keep out of your way and avoid offence. For
the rest, I compete. The law is an artificial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
line. The line is moved now and then. At
one time it's criminal to lend money at interest
and innocent to fight a duel. Another, it's
the other way. That's all right. But a man's
a fool not to fight inside the line as it happens
to stand. There's room enough."</p>

<p>Gard thought he saw some of his own philosophies
in caricature. They looked unlovely
enough in caricature. Map was an interesting
man. If peculiar, it was rather that his mind
was so sharp-edged, unqualifying, absolute.
It refused to see shades. It saw hard outlines
and felt the impact of surfaces. Gard
thought that at one time he would have found
him still more interesting and would not have
felt this repulsion from him. Probably convalescence
was a fastidious state. He turned
away to the window. There was a domed
mountain in sight, its spurs thrust forward
into the valley, sides covered partly with a
young-leaved forest, partly with pine and
hemlock, and its bald, rocky head bare in the
sunlight. The train stopped at a little station
by the river. The old, battered stage rolled
them away slumberously over an echoing
covered bridge, across the valley bottom lands,
where the zigzag fences and the calling of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
ploughman to his team, the bluebird on the zigzag
fence, and the slim white birches along
the mountain spurs all seemed in the same
concord with the ancient earth and childlike
sky. The silent, misanthropic stage-driver
looked the kin of the country-side's slow vegetation.</p>

<p>The road swung around the mountain and
went up through a dim green avenue of pines
and hemlocks, and below, in its bowldered
crypts and gorges, poured a stream with white
foam and mysterious song, or sometimes lay
still in black pools. The steep slope of the
mountain was on the left. The road climbed
steadily, and came out of the woods at last not
a mile from the village in a cup of the hills of
Hagar.</p>

<p>At the cross-roads Morgan stepped out and
Gard followed.</p>

<p>"The house is behind the church there."
Morgan said, shortly, and moved to walk away,
but stopped and turned half around when
Gard spoke, listening with his mouth set and
yellow brows drawn low.</p>

<p>"I dare say you'll succeed, you and your
philosophy," said Gard, slowly, looking towards
the church and the house behind it. "I dare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
say I sha'n't, in that way&mdash;or care to, very
much. Competition doesn't seem to me worth
while."</p>

<p>Morgan was silent. The battered stage
had rolled away down the hill to the post-office,
where Mr. Paulus came out for the mail, and
Thaddeus Bourn followed after him. Thaddeus
looked up the hill, dropped the iron point
of his cane on the stone step with a click,
and stared blankly. Mr. Paulus, mail-bag in
hand, stopped and followed the direction of
Thaddeus's eyes. The stage-driver climbed
down from his seat and joined them.</p>

<p>"I don't care," Gard continued, "a blank
cartridge what you did or tried to do. There's
no stipulation except that we keep out of each
other's way. Is that satisfactory?"</p>

<p>"That's all right." Morgan hesitated, and
brought out with apparent effort: "You'd
better look in the cemetery first; I saw something
there," went his way with long strides,
and disappeared down the first dip on the
Cattle Ridge road.</p>

<p>"There's a cemetery, very true," Gard
thought, and went towards it, past the minister's
picket fence and neat gate to where the
mournful hemlocks stood in meditation. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
there some one in a black dress was kneeling
and planting flowers over a new grave, and
near by was a tall, gray stone, and thereon,
graven in large letters:</p>

<p class="center p2 bold">
"SIMON BOURN,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"BORN &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  DIED &mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
"REMEMBER ME."<br /><br />
</p>

<p>Morgan swung along, and looked not to
right or left, nor cared if any villager speculated
on the singular sight of "one of the Map boys"
observably bound for the square house on the
hill; past the mill where Job Mather watched
his slow millstones, past the mill-pond, the
blacksmith's, and the rambling, low farm-house
that hived innumerable Durfeys, through the
stone pillars of Squire Map's gate, up to the
square house on the hill.</p>

<p>The door was locked. He rang the bell, and
waited some time. The place seemed half
deserted, unkept, the walks littered with last
year's rotting leaves.</p>

<p>The door opened suddenly and Squire Map
nearly filled it with broad, bowed shoulders.</p>

<p>"I've lost her, dad."</p>

<p>"Come in, Morgan."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>The latter followed into the dining-room
and they sat down. Opposite him on the wall
was the portrait of his mother in her bridal-dress.
A stately lady always, somewhat cold.
She seemed to wear her bridal-veil as a kind
of drapery for her pride. Morgan spread his
large hands on the table and looked at them.</p>

<p>"I played like hell for it."</p>

<p>"No doubt. Go on."</p>

<p>He told his story coolly and without omission.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are a worse man than your
brother," said the squire at last. "He is
more scrupulous. I liked you better. You
have more candor, carry more weight. I have
not been a scrupulous man."</p>

<p>Morgan was looking at the portrait.</p>

<p>"What did you want me to lose for? You
won."</p>

<p>"Won! No, I lost. So will you, soon or
late. Better soon than late." He followed
Morgan's eyes. "Your mother&mdash;I'd as lief
she'd have died twenty years earlier."</p>

<p>"This sort of thing is futile, dad. Why
don't you come out of your shell? Come and
get into the push again."</p>

<p>"What for? From my standpoint and my
age, Morgan, ask yourself&mdash;What for?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>Morgan laughed, lifted his fists, and let them
fall with a crash on the table.</p>

<p>"I'm young yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's a great deal in that. But one
draws no interest from time. You live on your
capital. But there's much in being at the
beginning instead of at the end&mdash;a great deal
in that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XXIII" id="Chapter_XXIII">Chapter XXIII</a>
<br /><br />
<small>The End</small></h2>

<p>"It is this way," said Thaddeus, "to speak
from a&mdash;a&mdash;personal standpoint. If Morgan
Map goes to the cemetery I shall not wait for
my mail, but go and&mdash;a&mdash;accidentally interrupt.
If he goes north, the other man may go
there, if he chooses. I shall wait for my mail."</p>

<p>"Your standpoint!" said Mr. Paulus, heavily.
"Well&mdash;speakin' from young Map's, what
might he want in the cemetery? Speakin' from
mine, I'd rather he'd go there and stay."</p>

<p>"My niece Helen is at present planting flowers
in the cemetery&mdash;in point of fact, roots."</p>

<p>Mr. Paulus was aroused. "They might do
some buttin'&mdash;think?"</p>

<p>"Gals! Shucks!" The stage-driver climbed
back to his seat and drove away. Mr. Paulus
looked after him, musingly.</p>

<p>"Willard Sickles," he said, "never would
have nothin' to do with women. He was born
drivin' mails!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pun?" asked Thaddeus, delicately, with his
eyes on the Four Corners. "Pun, Peter?"</p>

<p>"Hey?" Mr. Paulus was still thoughtful&mdash;abstracted.
"Lonesome and disgusted. Born
so. It's his nature."</p>

<p>The two at the Four Corners separated. Morgan
went north, Gard towards the cemetery.</p>

<p>"I thought they might do some buttin',"
said Mr. Paulus, as one grown used to disappointment,
and went in with his mail-bags.</p>

<p>Sundry villagers appeared, drifting slowly
to the focus of the post-office. Thaddeus took
off his glasses and put them with precision
into their case.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Pete intended a pun? Probably
not. Conversation is subject to accidents. It
is a pity that conversation is not&mdash;not more
secure."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gard entered the cemetery-gate and went
along the shrub-bordered path.</p>

<p>"Every man is the dungeon of himself, but
there is a key that unlocks mine."</p>

<p>He stepped from the path into the grass, and
Helen's apron was full of a mess of brown,
earthy roots. She started and cried out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
held up both hands to him, with the trowel in
one of them.</p>

<p>"I don't like my life, Nellie. Won't you
let me into yours?" And she dropped the
trowel and said, "Oh&mdash;why, yes," in a tone
that sounded like an after-climax, and Gard
took apron, yellow head, and all into his arms,
and scattered the roots beside Widow Bourn's
placid grave and Simon's stone, on which was
graven insistently, "Remember Me." A bluebird
warbled and cooed to himself on the fence
and paid no attention. The bold head of
Windless Mountain glimmered in the sun, that
swung low and near it. Presently the shadow
of Windless would sweep over Hagar with
noiseless rush, with silence, or the sleepy twittering
of day-birds.</p>

<p>"It was a long way here, Nellie. I went
nearly to the other end of everything to find
the path."</p>

<p>"Do you really love me? How long?"</p>

<p>"Long before I knew it. Do you mean how
long am I going to?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. Look, Gard! These will be
blue violets when they grow. They come from
behind the church, and mother liked them.
But you belong to me now, and you mustn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
stay here. It's cold under the hemlocks. You
must come out in the sun."</p>

<p>They went back along the path to the gate.
Over the fence in his garden the minister was
planting peas, arranging them according to
some theory of fitness, perhaps allegorically,
and humming a hymn out of tune. Knowing
that a tune was a spiritual mystery which
Providence did not permit him ever thoroughly
to penetrate, he only sang when he thought
himself alone, and in a subdued murmur. The
weather-vane of the militant church pointed
southwest at Windless Mountain, which meant
always a benevolent opinion about the weather.
The sun slipped behind the mountain, and the
shadow of Windless flowed over Hagar; over
Rachel standing at the lilac gate, waiting for
Helen, and liking the impersonal peace of the
hour; over Thaddeus stepping up the hill
from the post-office, and formulating certain
reflections on the use and abuse of accident
in the practice of conversation; over Helen
and Gard.</p>

<p>"You must learn all about Hagar, Gard.
That's the minister. He always pats his

<p>"Is that Windless? He looks like a gentleman.
Let's call the minister and let him pat
us on the head, show him it's a world of kisses
so he'll know what the trouble is, and tell him
to ring the bell to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Besides, if you're going to do
that, I'd rather only Windless saw."</p>

<p>"You'll be famous and glorious, won't you?
And I'll be proud&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Proud in a tower?"</p>

<p>"Oh, anywhere. Properly proud like Windless.
But we'll like best to be in Hagar, because
that will be home."</p>

<p>"I'll be something, or try to be, if you want
it. I'm a tired soldier now, Nellie, on sick
leave. I told the adjutant I was in love, too,
but he wouldn't put it in the permit. Let's go
home."</p>

<p>They went up past the militant church, and
Thaddeus and Rachel waited, smiling, at the
gate under the lilacs. Simon's epitaph and
the fading mountain were left facing each
other across the dusk. In any issue between
them, the dignity of law and time seemed to
be with the mountain as against the personal
claim, yet one did not come to Hagar to learn
among its twilights that humanity was degenerate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>

insistent identity was lawless; it might be an
amendment in the process of making.</p>

<p>"They're coming," said Thaddeus. "The
older I grow, Mrs. Mavering, the more I perceive
a certain dexterity in the&mdash;in fact, in

<p>Rachel only smiled and threw open the gate.</p>

PUT ASUNDER</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By</span> BASIL KING</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>This is the tenth of the twelve One-a-Month American
Novels to be published during 1901.</i></p>

<p>"The new volume in the American Novel Series, which
will, we doubt not, more than justify that undertaking
in the eyes of American readers. Mr. King has a firm
grasp of character; ... he handles dialogue with epigrammatic
felicity, and he has something to say....
Mr. King's study of his heroine is an admirable performance....
A novel worthy of the notice of all
thinking and observing Americans. Its qualities as a
story are deepened by its meaning as a study of temperament
and changing social conditions."&mdash;Richard
Henry Stoddard in <i>New York Mail and Express</i>.</p>

<p>"'Let Not Man Put Asunder' is clever, spicy, absorbing,
and thought-inspiring&mdash;a book with many
missions.... A novel in which the problems of
unhappy marriage and separation are very seriously
and comprehensively considered."&mdash;<i>New York World</i>.</p>

<p>"The story moves through unusually brilliant dialogue
and a series of exciting scenes to its swift and inevitable
conclusion."&mdash;<i>Public Opinion</i>, New York.</p>

<p>"A book that fairly throbs with intense interest from
start to finish.... Its characters are living portraitures.
It is thoroughly sane and sound."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Item</i>.</p>

<p><i>This is the first of the twelve One-a-Month American Novels
to be published during 1901.</i></p>

<p>"If each of the novels of American life by American
authors which Messrs. Harper &amp; Brothers project for the
current year proves as good as 'Eastover Court House,'
the twelve volumes will constitute a decided addition to
American fiction."&mdash;<i>Detroit Free Press</i>.</p>

<p>"Its charm lies in the constant succession of strongly
drawn pictures of life. One chapter after another presents
these scenes, as sharply outlined and deep in shadows as
an artistic photograph. The book ... is absolutely
fascinating."&mdash;<i>Louisville Courier-Journal</i>.</p>

<p>"Set in the midst of the fox-hunting and cross-country
regions, there is the hoof-beat of the galloping hunter all
through the story, which is full of dry humor and vivid
pen-pictures of life."&mdash;<i>Horse Show Monthly</i>.</p>

<p>"The horse stories are the best since David Harum's,
and quite as laughable as his."&mdash;<i>Chester Times</i>.</p>

<p><i>This is the second of the twelve One-a-Month American Novels

<p>"A novelist who sets out to depict a character like Becky
Sharp is likely to come to grief. Hence it is surprising that
Mr. Pier has not failed in portraying the social exile, Mrs.
Kent. The novel is strong and clever."&mdash;<i>Pittsburg Commercial-Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>"It is a very clever novel. There is story to it; there
is apt phrasing and clear delineation of character; there is
much incisive and delightful epigram."&mdash;<i>Evening Sun</i>.
New York.</p>

<p>"If the cleverest parts of this work had been entirely
cut out, we should have called it one of the cleverest novels
of the season."&mdash;<i>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</i>.</p>

and a delightful sense of humor."&mdash;<i>Chicago Tribune</i>.</p>

an impressive power revealed at each crisis of the
tale, which makes the pulses stir and the eye glisten. What
a book for the opening of the twentieth century!"&mdash;Julian
Hawthorne, in the <i>Journal</i>, New York.</p>

<p>"A very striking book, and one that I am quite sure will
take an enviable place in line with record-breakers. It
is the third of the 'American Novel Series,' and is entitled
'Martin Brook.' I finished it at one sitting, so intense
was my interest in it."&mdash;<i>Buffalo Commercial</i>, N.Y.</p>

<p>"The third of the 'American Novel Series,' 'Martin
Brook,' by Morgan Bates, appeals to the best in man and
woman, and is a credit alike to author and publishers.... 'Martin
Brook' is indeed an American novel, and of the
best kind."&mdash;Philadelphia <i>Daily Evening Telegraph</i>.</p>

<p>"One's interest is caught and held by the hero from the
moment of his first appearance in its pages.... There
has not been a stronger scene [the library scene] written to
revive the interest of jaded novel readers for many a day."&mdash;<i>N.Y.

<p><i>This is the fifth of the twelve One-a-Month American Novels

<p>"Mr. Townsend has given us a novel that is a strong
and vigorous picture of contemporary New York. He tells
his story with the gayety and charm and light-hearted
high spirits of one to whom the passing show of life is still
full of interest, and he succeeds in interesting the reader.
There is not a dull line in the book."&mdash;<i>New York Journal</i>.</p>

<p>"The love story is well told, but the chief interest of the
novel lies in its contrasted pictures of New York life&mdash;from
Fifth Avenue to Hell's Kitchen."&mdash;<i>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</i>.</p>

<p>"Mr. Townsend has made a very striking and daring
use of his experience as a newspaper man.... He has
gone about his business with vigor and decision....
There is hardly a chapter which does not stand out through
sheer force of the author's fund of anecdote and observation
and humor."&mdash;<i>New York Commercial Advertiser</i>.</p>
